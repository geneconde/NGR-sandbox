msgstr "曾經被叫錯名字嗎？這是很常見的。有時候老師會把你叫成你姊姊或哥哥的名字。有時候你的爺爺奶奶也會把你叫成你的叔叔或是你父母的名字。真是不可思議，但它隨時都在發生。為什麼呢？因為他們都與你有關係！"

msgid "You have similar relationships with your own parents and siblings.  You even share characteristics with your grandparents and cousins. It’s because you have inherited your characteristics from your mother and father."
msgstr "你與你的父母和兄弟姊妹有相近的關係。你甚至與你的父母和兄弟姊妹有共同的特徵。那是因為你遺傳了你爸爸和媽媽的特徵。"

Traits that never skip generations are <span class='key'>dominant</span>. The information that causes a trait to appear is known as a <span "

msgstr "遺傳的規則適用於所有類型的植物和動物的有性生殖。性狀是我們在所有生物體上所看到的特徵。性狀有時候隔代遺傳被認為是隱性的。從來未隔代遺傳的性狀是顯性的。導致性狀出現的信息被稱為一個基因。事實上基因在一個結構上攜帶化學性的訊息，就是所謂的染色體，被發現於細胞的細胞核中。每一個人的每一個細胞中攜帶兩套染色體，各來自於父親與母親。為此原因，每位父母貢獻了製造一個個體所需的一半信息。"

msgid "Ever wonder why you have two parents? We all do, you know. It's one of the few things that's true for all people. Even though some families may have only one parent in the home, or other families have two same-sex parents, every living person has both a female biological parent and a male biological parent. Parents of opposite sexes are the reason our form of reproduction is called <span class='key'>sexual reproduction</span>."
msgstr "有沒有想過，為什麼你有父親和母親呢？大家都如此，你知道的。這是為數不多可通用於所有人的事情之一。即使有些家庭可能只有一個家長，或是其他家庭有兩個同性的父母，每一個活著的人都有一個女性親輩和一名男性親輩。異性父母是我們繁殖形式的原因，被稱為有性生殖。"

msgid ""
"The simplest form of reproduction in nature is called <span class='key'>asexual reproduction</span>. This occurs when new organisms break away in some fashion from a parent organism. Asexual reproduction is common in single-cell organisms, plants and a few animals. It produces clones or exact copies of the parent. While this process is very efficient, the sameness of the individuals it produces is a disadvantage in many types of living "

msgstr "在自然界中繁殖的最簡單形式，被稱為無性繁殖。這發生在當新的生物體以某種方式從母體脫離時。無性生殖常見於單細胞生物、植物和少數動物。它產生無性殖株或是完全複製親代。雖然這個過程是非常有效的，但在許多類型的生物而言，它產生了完全相同的個體是不利的。"

msgid "When the environment changes in some way, it’s important that all members of a living population not be the same. Diversity helps to ensure that new combinations of inherited traits make the survival of at least some members of a population possible when conditions become difficult."
msgstr "當環境改變，一個生物群體中的所有成員不相同是很重要的。多樣性有助於確保遺傳性狀的新組合，使得在生活條件困難的時候，群體中至少有一部分可能得以生存。"

msgid ""
"Sexual reproduction works because every individual has two copies of each chromosome, the cell structures that carry information. Each plant or animal receives one copy of each chromosome from each parent. They then are able to pass only one of each chromosome on to their own offspring. Since it is equally likely that either of each chromosome may be passed on to any offspring, all combinations of chromosomes are possible.  This allows for "
"new combinations of chromosomes and the traits they carry every generation."
msgstr "有性生殖是因每個個體有兩套染色體，每一條都攜帶了信息。每個植物或動物接收來自親代的每條染色體的其中一條副本。然後，它們只能讓各一條染色體傳至自己的後代。每條染色體被傳遞到任何後代的可能性是相同的，染色體的所有組合都有可能。使得染色體有新的組合和性狀一代傳一代。"

msgid "A chart like this is called a <span class='key'>pedigree</span>. Males are shown as squares and females are shown as circles. Family  members with the dominant trait are colored red. Recessives are colored blue. The lines show the relationships within the family. Parents are linked together, and lines extend to their offspring."

msgstr "仔細看。紅色的性狀出現在每個世代。在所有情況下，至少一個紅色個體的親代也顯示出紅色性狀。"

msgid "This pedigree looks a bit different. Once again, red is dominant. Individuals having both red and blue carry one copy of each gene, but show the red trait.  Even though they appear to be dominant, it’s possible for red parents to have blue offspring.  Blue parents never have red offspring."

msgid "More big ideas about... inherited traits"
msgstr "更多關於「遺傳性狀」的大概念"

msgid "The inheritance of nearly all traits follows only a few simple rules. The first big rule is that everyone has two genes for every characteristic, inheriting one from each parent. Individuals may pass only one gene for each characteristic on to any offspring. The second big rule is that genes don’t usually influence each other, that is to say that the gene inherited for nose shape doesn’t determine the gene inherited for short big toes."
msgstr "幾乎所有性狀的遺傳僅遵循幾條簡單的規則。第一個大的規則是，每個人的每個特徵都有兩個基因，分別遺傳自父母。每個個體的每個特徵，只可以有一個基因遺傳給後代。第二個大的規則是，基因通常不會互相影響，也就是說，鼻子形狀的基因不會決定又短又大的腳趾。"

msgid "Then, there's something called <span class='key'>dominance</span>. Genes are not all created equal. Some genes cause their traits to be displayed every generation.  They are called dominant genes. Others can seem to skip generations, only to appear again in descendants of later generations. They are called <span class='key'>recessive</span>."
msgstr "然後，還有一種叫主導地位。基因是並非所有平等的。某些基因會導致它們的性狀被顯現在每一代，它們被稱為顯性基因。其它似乎可以隔代遺傳，只再次出現在後代子孫，它們被稱為隱性的。"

msgid "A white male guinea pig had many generations of all-white ancestors. A black female guinea pig also had many generations of all-black ancestors. When the guinea pigs were allowed to mate, all of their offspring were black. When two of the resulting black guinea pigs mated, three-fourths of their offspring were also black, but one-fourth were white."
msgstr "白色雄性天竺鼠具有許多代全白的祖先。黑的雌性天竺鼠也有許多代全黑的祖先。當天竺鼠交配，所有的子代都是黑色的。當交配產生的兩隻天竺鼠子代再交配，3/4子代也是黑色的，1/4的子代為白色的。"

msgid "Well, the recessive color was white, because white fur was hidden in the first set of offspring. That means black is the dominant color.  We often use letters to represent dominant and recessive genes. Since any individual always has two genes for every characteristic, the original parents in the problem would have these combinations:"
msgstr "那麼，隱性顏色為白色，因為白色皮毛被隱藏在第一組子代。這意味著黑色是顯性顏色。我們經常用字母來代表顯性和隱性基因。因為任何個體的每個特徵總是有兩個基因，所以親代將有一下這些組合："

msgid "Original Black parent:"
msgstr "原來的黑色親代："

msgid "Original White parent:"
msgstr "原來的白色親代："

msgid "This genetic shorthand tells us the <span class='key'>genotype</span> of an individual.  Genotype is the actual combination of genes an individual has, even those we can’t easily detect. The appearance the genotype causes is called an individual's <span class='key'>phenotype</span>. Phenotypes are usually described by adjectives like black, white, tall and short. Genotypes are indicated by letters or symbols."
msgstr "此種遺傳縮寫告訴我們個體的基因型。基因型是一個個體具有基因的結合。即使那些我們不能輕易察覺。基因型的表現被稱為個體的表現型。表現型通常被描述特徵如黑、白、高和矮。基因型是由字母或符號表示。"

msgid "The first set of offspring in the problem must have a gene from each parent. The white parent has only the f gene. The black parent has only F. The genotype of all of their offspring must be Ff. Their phenotype is black, but they all carry a recessive white gene."
msgstr "在問題中，第一組子代必須有一個基因分別來自親代。白色親代只具有f基因，黑色親代只具有F基因。它們所有的子代的基因型必為Ff。其表現型為黑色，但它們都攜帶一個白色的隱性基因。"

msgid "This one is tricky. Using the same rules of dominance we saw above, we would predict that the offspring were both Bb.  Two Bb parents should be able to have both brown and black offspring. The problem comes up when we’re asked to predict how many of either color are likely."
msgstr "這是一個棘手的問題。利用我們上面所看到的顯性地位的規則，我們可以預測子代均為Bb。兩個Bb親代，應會有棕色和黑色的子代。當我們被問到預測有每個顏色各有多少的可能性時，問題就來了。"

msgstr "最初的親代是棕色和黑色小鼠。由於所有的子代小鼠呈現棕色，棕色必為顯性。黑色的親代為bb。棕色的親代可能有任一基因型，但是棕色的子代都必須為Bb，因為它們接收來子親代的b。"

"The single letters in the top row and left column show that each parent passes along half of its genes.  The combinations in the table are the only possible gene combinations possible in the next generation. Three of the genotypes have B, resulting in brown mice. Only one has bb, leading to black mice. So, each individual has a 3/4  chance of being brown, and 1/4 chance of being black. Another way to say this is that in any litter, 3/4 are "

msgstr "最上面一行和左欄的單一字母表示親代傳遞的一半基因組，在表中的組合是下一代唯一可能的基因組合。有三種基因型具有B，產生棕色的小鼠。只有一種具有bb，產生黑色的小鼠。所以，每個個體有3/4的機率為棕色，有1/4的機率為黑色。另一種說法是，在任何的飼養籠中，預計有3/4為棕色，預計有1/4為白色。"

Every new individual receives half of its inherited information from its mother, and half from its father. The half from the mother is a random set of the information inherited from her own parents. The same is true for information inherited from the father."
msgstr "幾乎所有植物和動物都進行有性生殖，也就是說，它們具有雌性和雄性的親代。每一個新的個體接收一半來自母親的遺傳信息與一半來自父親的遺傳信息。母親一半的基因組是隨機遺傳自她自己父母的遺傳信息，父親也同樣是如此。"

msgid "Some characteristics are sometimes absent in a generation, only to reappear in later generations. These are said to be <span class = 'key'>recessive traits</span>. These <span class = 'key'>traits</span> only appear when an individual inherits the same gene from each parent. <span class = 'key'>Dominant traits</span> never skip generations. They appear even when their gene is inherited from only one parent."
msgstr "有時候有些特徵會消失在一個世代之中，只會再次出現在下一個世代，這些被認為是隱性性狀。這些性狀只會出現在當一個人的遺傳來自於父母的同一個基因。顯性性狀從來沒有隔代遺傳。它甚至會出現在只從親代那裡得到一個這種基因，而有顯性性狀。"

msgid "The random rearrangement of <span class = 'key'>genes</span> in each generation allows every species to have new combinations of genes all the time. These unique gene combinations are sometimes important to species survival."
msgstr "每一世代基因的隨機排列讓每一物種無時無刻都有新的基因組合。有時候這些獨特的基因組合對於物種的生存是至關重要的。"

msgid "It is possible to use the rules of probability to make predictions about past or future generations if we have information about other members of the same family. These predictions may be made about <span class = 'key'>genotype </span> (the actual genetic information) or <span class = 'key'> phenotype </span> (the visible traits coded for by genes)."
msgstr "如果我們擁有關於同一個家族成員的訊息，我們是可能可以利用機率的規則來預測過去的和未來的世代。這些預測可能為基因型（實際的遺傳信息）或表現型（通過基因編碼的可見性狀）。"

msgid "Chromosome"
msgstr "染色體"

msgid "A threadlike structure found in cells that contains their DNA.  Each is made of tightly bound strands of DNA coiled together."

msgid "Dominant"
msgstr "顯性"

msgid "An allele, or trait, that when present in an organism’s DNA, it will appear in the organism’s phenotype.  For example, if brown hair is dominant over red hair, a person with the gene for brown hair will have brown hair, even if they also have the gene for red hair."
msgstr "一個等位基因或性狀，當存在於生物體的DNA，它會顯現在生物體的表現型。例如，如果棕色頭髮是顯性的大過於紅色，一個人有棕色頭髮的基因，即使他也有紅色頭髮的基因，但他的頭髮就會是棕色的。"

msgid "A portion of a strand of DNA that codes for a specific protein.  There are often multiple versions of the same gene.  Genes can be dominant or recessive, depending on which variant is present in an organism.  An organism will possess two versions of each gene, which may be the same or different."
msgstr "DNA上有決定特定的蛋白質的密碼。相同的基因常常有多種情況。基因可以是顯性或是隱性，這取決於對偶基因的哪一種情況出現在生物體裡。一個生物體會有兩種對偶基因的情況，它們可以是相同的或是不同的。"

msgstr "基因型"

msgid "The combination of genes present in an organism.  When both versions of a gene are the same and they are the dominant version, the genotype is said to be “homozygous dominant.”  When both versions of a gene are the same and they are the recessive version, the genotype is said to be “homozygous recessive.”  When an organism possesses one dominant gene and one recessive gene, it is said to be “heterozygous\"."
msgstr "存在於生物體的基因組合。當相對於染色體上的對偶基因是相同的，然後又是顯性的，稱為“顯性同型合子”。當生物體具有一個顯性基因和一個隱性基因，被稱為 “異型合子”。"
