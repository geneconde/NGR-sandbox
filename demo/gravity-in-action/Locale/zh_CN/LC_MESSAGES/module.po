# 6
msgid "Imagine a catastrophic event in which a huge asteroid slams into the Moon in a head on collision.  The asteroid was completely obliterated (destroyed) and no traces are left behind.  The Moon’s structure remained intact after the collision (it remained the same in terms of mass and shape) – the only thing that changed was the Moon’s orbital velocity which was significantly slowed due to force of impact.  Which of the following statements would be true following the collision?"
msgstr ""
