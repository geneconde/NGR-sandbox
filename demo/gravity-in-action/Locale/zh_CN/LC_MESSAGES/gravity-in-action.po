msgid "Have you ever seen a tug of war between two teams? Each team holding the rope is separated by a certain distance and both are trying to pull the other over a line. It might be hard to imagine a tug of war game without a rope, but such a contest is constantly taking place as objects throughout the universe pull on other objects with a force called <span class='key'>gravity</span>."
msgstr "你曾經看過兩個隊伍拔河嗎？每隊都拉著繩子分別在兩側的一定距離，且他們都試著將另一隊拉過線。很難去想像一場沒有繩子的拔河比賽，但是像這樣的比賽的情形，是在宇宙中的每一個物體拉著另一個物體發生時的力，稱作為引力。"

msgid "Checking what you already know about... gravity in action"
msgstr "看看你已經知道哪些有關……引力作用"

msgid "You may have heard that all objects exert a gravitational force on other objects. You may also have wondered, then, why you don't feel this force. Although the force between most paired objects cannot be felt, you can indeed feel the force between the earth and you. "
msgstr "你可能聽過所有的物體對其他的物體施予引力。你可能也曾想過，如果這樣，為什麼你不會感覺到這些力。雖然這些在兩兩物體之間的力無法被感覺到，你可以確實的感受到地球與你之間的力。它被感覺到就如你的體重。"

msgid " It is felt as your weight. If you jump up in the air, you can count on being pulled back toearth. But what do you think would happen if you jumped up and there was no such thing as gravity? Think about your experience with gravity, for example, jumping to grab an apple from a tree or watching rain falling from a dark cloud. Based on your experience, how would you describe gravity's force?"
msgstr "如果你跳躍到空中，你可以指望會被拉回地面。但是你想想如果你跳起來且那裡沒有像是引力的東西會發生什麼事？想想看你經驗中的引力，舉例來說，跳起來抓住樹上的蘋果或是觀看從黑雲降下的雨。根據你的經驗，你會如何描述引力？"

msgid "Gravity is a force that pushes objects in opposite directions."
msgstr "引力是將物體推向反方向的力。"

msgid "Gravity is a force that pulls objects toward each other."
msgstr "引力是拉物體相互接近的力。"

msgid "Gravity is a force that can both push and pull on objects."
msgstr "引力是可以拉與推物體的力。"

msgid "Gravity is a force that acts when objects touch each other."

msgid "Reviewing big ideas about... gravity in action"
msgstr "複習有關主要的概念……引力作用"

msgid "A <span class='key'>force</span> is a push or a pull. For example, you have to exert a force to push your friend on a swing or to pull them in a wagon. <span class='key'>Gravity</span> is also a force, but it is special in several ways. Gravity acts only to pull objects toward each other, whether the objects are touching or not."
msgstr "一個力會是推或拉。舉例來說，你施力推一位在鞦韆上的朋友或是拉坐在馬車上的他們。引力也是一種力，但是它有很多特別的地方。引力作用只有讓物體相互拉近，無論物體是不是正在接觸中。"

msgid "There are two factors that affect how much the force of gravity will pull two or more objects together. The first factor is the masses of the objects involved. The more massive the objects are, the greater the gravitational force between them will be. For example, the gravitational force between a 10kg and a 5kg object is twice as strong as between two 5 kg objects; and the gravitational force between two 10kg objects is four times as strong as between two 5 kg objects."
msgstr "有兩個因素會影響引力拉兩個或是更多物體在一起的程度。第一個因素是物體的的質量。當物體的質量越大，它們之間的引力也就會越大。舉例來說，十公斤跟五公斤物體間的引力是兩個五公斤物體間引力的兩倍；且兩個十公斤物體間的引力是兩個五公斤物體間引力的四倍。"

msgid "The force of gravity between objects is measured in <span class='key'>Newtons</span>. If one object is many times more massive than another object, we refer to the gravitational force on the smaller object as its weight. So when you weigh yourself on a standard bathroom scale, your weight is the gravitational force between you and the Earth."
msgstr "物體間的引力用牛頓來作為測量單位。如果有一個物體是另一個物體質量的好幾倍，我們會參考較小物體的的引力作為它的重量。所以當你在一個浴室用的標準磅秤上秤你自己的重量，你的重量是你與地球之間的引力。"

msgid "Massive objects exert a stronger pull than less massive objects."
msgstr "巨大的物體會比較小的物體產生更大的拉力。"

msgid "Astronauts weigh much less on the moon than on Earth because the moon’s mass is much smaller than the mass of the earth. So the gravitational force between the moon and a person is less than the gravitational force between the earth and that same person."
msgstr "太空人在月球上會比地球上重量輕很多，因為月球的質量比地球小了很多。所以月球與人之間的引力會比同一個人與地球之間的引力來得小。"

msgid "The second factor affecting gravitational force is the distance between objects. The farther away two objects are from each other, the weaker the gravitational force is between them. The closer they are, the stronger the force is. So, unlike pushing or pulling a wagon where you have to be in contact with the wagon, the gravitational force between objects acts across distance—the objects don't have to touch!"
msgstr "第二個影響引力的因素是物體之間的距離。兩個物體之間的距離越遠，它們之間的引力就會越弱。它們越接近，力量就會越強。所以，不像是在推或拉一部馬車時你需要接觸到馬車，物體之間的引力作用是超越距離的—物體間不需要接觸！"

msgid "Given equal masses, objects that are far apart exert less gravitational force on each other than objects that are close together."
msgstr "給予相等的質量，相距很遠的物體所產生的引力比相近在一起的物體引力來得小。"

msgid "All objects exert a gravitational pull on other objects. This holds true in the case of the Earth’s moon. Just as the earth is pulling on the moon, the moon is pulling on the earth. <span class='key'>Ocean tides</span> are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon on the mass of water in the earth’s oceans. Because ocean water is a liquid and can move, it “bulges up” from the pull of the moon’s gravity towards the moon’s position on any given day."
msgstr "所有的物體都會產生引力拉其他的物體。在地球的月球這個例子裡是成立的。就像是地球拉著月球，月球拉著地球。海洋潮汐是由月球對地球的海洋裡大量的水的引力造成。因為海洋是液體且可以移動的，它在在不同日子裡對向月球的位置所施的引力使它會隆起。"

msgid "A \"bulge\" of ocean water is created as the moon's gravity pulls in a direct line between the earth and the moon. The moon's gravitational pull is the strongest along a direct line between the earth and the moon. It is at that place a bulge of water occurs. That bulge is known as a <span class='key'>lunar tide</span>, which is also called high tide. The bulge is always found in that direct line, but as the earth rotates on its axis, the bulge is seen to move from east to west on Earth's surface."
msgstr "海水的隆起是地球與月亮成一條直線時由月亮的引力拉著。月球引力的拉力在地球與月球成為一直線時是最大的。在那個位置時會發生水的隆起。那個隆起被認為是月亮潮汐，也被稱作高潮。這個隆起總是在成一直線時被發現，但是地球繞著它的自轉軸轉動，所以隆起看起來像是在地表上從東向西的移動。"

msgid "Moon's <br><br> gravitational <br><br> pull"

msgstr "綠色部分顯示了力的相對大小－並不是水位高度的變化。事實上水位從高潮變化到低潮只有幾呎而已。"

msgid "There is also an ocean bulge on the other side of the earth that is opposite the moon on the same direct line. The two bulges are what cause high tides twice each day. The tidal bulge of water on the other side of the earth from the moon is caused by centrifugal force, also called inertia, from the earth spinning on its axis. Low tides are the areas of the earth’s oceans in-between the two high tide bulges."
msgstr "有另一個海洋隆起發生在地球的另一端，那是月亮在同一條線上的相反位置。這兩個隆起就是造成一天的兩次高潮。這從月球作用在地球的另一邊水的潮汐隆起，是由地球在自轉軸上轉動的離心力，也被稱為慣性，所造成。地球上海洋低潮地區是在－兩個高潮隆起之間。"

msgid "Looking at the moon..."
msgstr "看著月亮……"

msgid "No, this sentence is true. Tides are caused by the pull of the moon, sun, and Earth rotating on its axis."
msgstr "否，這個句子是對的。潮汐是由月亮、太陽、地球在軸上旋轉的拉力造成。"

msgid "No, this sentence is true. All objects exert a gravitational pull on other objects. We might not feel it all the time, but it works both ways."
msgstr "否，這個句子是對的。所有物體對其它物體施予引力。我們可能無法在所有時刻都感受到，但它是如此作用著。"

"Because we live on Earth, most people experience (or observe) the phenomena of gravity as things \"falling to Earth\". But if all things that went up truly fell back to Earth, devices such as cell phones and TVs would not work as they do today. That's because such devices depend upon connections with a communication <span class='key'>satellite</span> that is rocketed up to a distance where the earth's gravity is much weaker. If we were able to turn off Earth's gravity, the satellite boosted into space would keep going. But we can't turn off gravity. It follows that the satellite begins to fall back to earth. But rather than falling straight back, the satellite begins to \"curve\" back to Earth until it enters a stable orbit around the planet. A stable orbit requires a balance of enough speed to keep the object from "

msgstr "因為我們生活在這個世界上，大多數的人感受（或觀察）到引力的現象是當東西掉到地上時。但是如果所有上升的東西都會掉回地上，一些設備像是行動電話與電視就不會像它們現在這樣運作。那是因為這些設計是靠著連結到那些被發射到地球之外的通訊衛星，在那裏的地球引力較弱。如果我們可以關閉地球的引力，衛星會繼續升高至太空中。但是我們無法關閉引力。發生的話衛星會掉回到地球上。但是比起直直地墜回地球，衛星會開始盤旋回地球直到它進入行星周圍穩定的軌道。一個穩定的軌道需要足夠的速度來平衡才能保持物體不會完全墜回地球，但是也不能速度太快讓它衝進太空中。"

msgid "Much like the example with the satellite above, the Moon can be described as Earth's satellite. Indeed, a moon is defined as both a celestial body and a natural satellite. It is a <span class='key'>celestial body</span> because it is an object found in space and it is a <span class='key'>natural satellite</span> because the moon orbits the earth. Like the communication satellites revolving around Earth, the moon is in a perfect balance of motion. If the moon had any more <span class='key'>velocity</span>, it would fly off into space. But if the moon had any less velocity, it would spiral toward Earth until it crashed into Earth's surface. Thus, the Earth-Moon system is another example of a satellite system--a perfect balance of motion and gravity."

"All objects in the universe exert a gravitational force on each other. The force of <span class='key'>gravity</span> pulls objects together without the objects actually being in physical contact with each other. There are two factors that affect the strength of gravity. The first is the mass of the object and the second is the distance between objects. The larger the mass, the greater the gravitational force it exerts. The farther away two objects are from each other, the weaker the gravitational force is between them. It's important to note that all objects exert a gravitational force on all other objects. Just as the earth is pulling on the moon, the moon is pulling on the earth. <span class='key'>Ocean tides</span> are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon. Earth's gravitational force extends far space. In "
"outer space, gravitational forces of planets and stars account for the order and structure of solar systems and galaxies. The system of the moon orbiting Earth depends on a perfect balance of motion and gravity. In the case of <span class='key'>satellites</span> in general, a stable orbit requires a balance of enough speed to keep the object from falling completely back to Earth, but not so much speed that it shoots off into space."
msgstr "所有在宇宙中的物體都會產生引力且相互作用。引力可以將物體拉在一起且不需要真的直接有物理上的相互接觸。其中有兩項因素會影響引力的強度。第一是物體的質量，而第二是物體之間的距離。較大的質量，會產生較大的引力。兩個物體之間的距離越遠，兩者之間的的引力就會越弱。還有一點需要注意的是所有的物體所產生的引力是對所有其他的物體作用的。就像是地球拉住月球，月球拉住地球。海洋潮汐是受到月球引力的拉力所造成。地球的引力延伸很大的空間。在外太空，行星與星體的引力和太陽系與銀河系的秩序與結構有關。月球環繞地球的系統建立在一個運動與引力的完美平衡之上。在一般衛星的例子中，一個穩定的軌道需要足夠的速度來平衡避免物體完全墜回地球，但是不會太快到衝到太空中。"

Thus, a ball that is from rest dropped from a cliff will be falling, not accounting for air resistance, at 9.8 meters per second after one second. After two seconds, it will be falling at 9.8 x 2 = 19.6 meters per second. And after three seconds, the ball will be falling at 9.8 x 3 = 29.4 meters per second. Thus, objects increase in speed as they are falling, covering more distance each second they are in the air. The following image of a falling basketball demonstrates this. The ball’s position, beginning with it being held and dropped at the top, is pictured after each 1/20th of a second. Notice how the basketball is covering more distance during each additional 1/20th of a second that it falls."
