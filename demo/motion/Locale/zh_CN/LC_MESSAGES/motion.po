"All around us, we can find examples of objects in motion. From large things like buses and airplanes, to small things like birds and bugs, it seems like things are always moving. But did you know that even the things that we see as being at rest might be considered to be moving by someone else? One of Albert Einstein’s most famous observations was that all motion is relative. While you might agree with the person sitting next to you about the motion of a bird outside a window at your school, a person riding by in a bus might have a different description of the bird’s motion. Your ability to observe the bird is limited by what you can see out of your window. You might lose sight of the bird once it flies past your window, but the passenger on the bus might have a different experience if the bird flies fast enough to keep up with the bus. Similarly, when you "
"look up at the sky at night, it might be difficult to notice any motion amongst the stars above. But if you make careful observations over many nights, you’ll start to notice things moving around. Some of this motion can be explained by the motion of the Earth through the Solar System. Some of the motion is because some of those bright points of light aren’t stars. They might be man-made satellites orbiting the Earth or other planets that are also orbiting the Sun. Even the starts themselves are in motion, though it takes centuries to observe changes in their location in the sky."
msgstr "在我們周圍，可以發現正在運動物體的例子。大到如公車和飛機，小到如鳥和昆蟲，似乎遠永都在不停的移動。但是你知道嗎？我們就算看到一樣東西靜止不動，在別人眼裡卻看來正在移動。愛因斯坦最著名的觀點之一，是所有的運動都是相對的。你可能會同意，坐在你旁邊的人與一個坐在公車上的人，看窗外鳥兒的運動有不同的描述。你能看見窗外鳥兒的能力是有限的。一旦牠飛過你的窗口，牠可能會消失於你的視線，但如果鳥飛行的速度不快且能跟上公車行駛的速度，在公車上的乘客可能有不同的體驗。但如果你仔細觀察過無數個夜晚，你會開始看到星體的移動。這些運動，可以被地球在太陽系的運動來解釋。有些運動是因為其中的明亮光點，而那不是星星。它們可能是繞著地球轉的人造衛星，或是繞著太陽轉的其他行星。即使恆星是自己開始運動，但也需要幾百年來觀察它在天空中的位置變化，"

msgid "Click on <span class='blink'>All</span> the objects that are in motion!"
msgstr "請點擊所有運動中的物體！"

msgid "If you clicked on all of the objects, you’re moving in the right direction.  All motion is relative, even if it’s so slow we don’t see it right away.  If you see the moon in the sky at night, and look for the moon again an hour later, it’ll be in a new location.  Same thing with the clock on the wall, the hour hand moves slowly, but in six hours, it’ll be pointing in the opposite direction!"
msgstr "如果你點擊了所有的物體，您正朝著正確的方向前進。即使在我們沒看到的時候，物體是動得如此緩慢，但所有的運動都是相對的。如果你看到月亮在夜空中，過一個小時後再看看月亮，它又會在另一個新的位置。同樣的在牆上的時鐘也是如此，時針移動的非常緩慢，但在六小時後，它的指針會指向相反方向！"

msgid "Walking on the sidewalks..."
msgstr "走在人行道上..."

msgid "Since all motion is relative, an important part of the description of any object's motion is the frame of reference. Usually, the <span class=key>frame of reference</span> is based on the immediate surroundings. For a football game, the frame of reference might be the lines on the field. They mark the <span class=key>position</span> of the players and the ball as they move from one end to the other. They provide specific information on the location of the objects. Without the markings on the field, it would be difficult to know when a team has made a first down or scored a touchdown.  The lines of the field help the referees and players to know where they are and where they are going."
msgstr "由於所有的運動都是相對的，任何物體運動的一個重要部分的描述是參考座標。通常參考座標相對於周圍環境。對於一場足球比賽，參考座標可能是賽場上的線。當他們從一端移動到另一端，它們標誌著球員的位置和球。他們提供物體位置的特定信息。如果沒有在球場上標記，將很難知道一支球隊已經取得第一次進攻或是觸地得分。場上的線幫助裁判和球員知道他們在哪裡和他們要去哪裡。"

msgid "Another frame of reference might be your neighborhood. Giving directions to a new neighbor might include references to specific landmarks, like a bank, or the post office, or your school! Similarly, compass directions allow us to be specific when giving directions to someone else. Saying that the new store is two miles East of the school is more helpful than just saying that it is two miles away. Street signs can provide helpful reference points along the way!"
msgstr "另外一項參考座標可能是你的鄰居。給予新鄰居的指示可能包括引用特定地標，如銀行、郵局，或者你的學校！同樣地，指南針為一個人指路的時候給我們明確的方向。如果說一家新開的店在學校以東兩英里處，比僅說它在兩英里外更有幫助。路牌可以提供在道路上前進有益的參考點！"

msgid "A helpful diagram for representing motion can be a <span class=key>motion map</span>. A motion map simply records where an object is located within the frame of reference. Consider the image below showing the location of the team on the field at the beginning of each play. Mapping the motion this way can allow you to see which team is faster at getting the ball from one end of the field to the other. In this image, the blue helmets are moving the ball by 15 yards each play, and the gold helmets are moving the ball by 25 yards each play. The bigger spaces between the images of the gold helmets means that they are moving the ball down the field faster."
msgstr "一個針對運動表示有用的示意圖可作為一種運動圖。動態圖簡單地記錄一個物體在參考座標中的所在位置。考慮以下每場比賽開始時，球隊在場上所在位置之圖示。描繪出運動的方式可以讓您看到在場上是哪支球隊較快的讓球從一端傳到另一端。在此圖像中，藍色頭盔的球隊在每次比賽中移動球15碼(13.7公尺)，金色頭盔的球隊在每次比賽中移動球15碼(22.9公尺)。金色頭盔的球隊在圖像中的空間較大，意味這他們在比賽場中移動球較快。"

msgid "Stroboscopic photos show multiple images of a moving object in one picture, and can provide information about the motion of the object, just like a motion map. In this image, the ball is moving slowest at the top of the photo, and that’s why the images are so close together. The ball isn’t moving as far between images."
msgstr "動態鏡盤的照片將一個運動的物體的多個圖像顯示在一個畫面中，並且可以提供物體運動的資訊，就像是一個動態圖。在此圖像中，照片的上方的球移動速度最慢，這就是為什麼圖像是如此接近的原因。球在圖像中是不動的。"

msgid "Preparing your first quick check…"

msgid "Nope. These images are evenly spaced, so this duck’s motion is constant."
msgstr "不。此圖像間隔是均勻的，所以這個鴨子的運動是恆定的。"

msgid "Not quite. These images are farther apart than in A, but they are still evenly spaced, so this duck’s motion is also constant."
msgstr "不。這些圖像比A相隔的更遠，但它們仍然是均勻間隔，所以這個鴨子的運動也是恆定的。"

msgid "You’ve got it! The images of this duck keep getting farther apart, indicating that this duck is getting faster!"
msgstr "你答對了！此圖中的鴨子相隔越來越遠，表示這隻鴨子運動的越來越快。"

msgid "Nope. The images of this duck are getting closer together, so this duck appears to be slowing down."
msgstr "不。此圖中的鴨子相隔越來越近，所以這個鴨子速度似乎漸漸放慢。"

msgid "More big ideas about... motion"
msgstr "更多有關「運動」的大概念"

msgid "Often, a convenient frame of reference for motion is a number line. With Zero in the center, the numbers are increasingly positive as you go to the right, and increasingly negative as you go to the left. Identifying the position of the object on the number line allows you to be more specific about the location. Saying the object is at -3 is more specific than saying the object is 3 spaces from 0."
msgstr "一個方便於表示運動的參考座標往往為數字線。零點位於中心，當你往右邊走，數量也會越來越正，如果你往左邊，就會越來越負。在數字線上所標示物體的位置，讓你更明確知道位置。說一個物體在-3比說物體到0的距離有3格來的更明確。"

msgid "We can use the information from the data table to see that Object A is moving faster than object B.  Object A is moving two positions towards the right every 10 seconds, while Object B only moves one position to the right every 10 seconds.  We can also see that Object A catches up to Object B after 50 seconds because the data table shows both objects are at the same position at that time.  We can also use patterns in the numbers to predict where the objects will be at a later point in time.  If the motion continues with the same pattern shown in the data table, Object A will be at position 7 and Object B will be at position 6 after 60 seconds."
msgstr "我們從數據表中的信息看到，物體A的移動速度快於物體B。物體A每10秒向右移動兩個位置，同時B每10秒只向右移動一個位置。我們還可以看到，物體A在50秒後趕上物體B，因為數據表示這兩個物體當時在同一位置上。我們也可以利用數字的變化模式來預測物體之後的所在位置。如果物體依照表格上的模式持續運動，60秒後物體A會在位置7和物體B會在位置6的地方。"

msgid "A <span class=key>unit of measure</span> allows the data table to be even more specific. Often, distances are measured in terms of feet, yards, or miles in the United States. In countries that use the metric system, those same measurements might be in centimeters, meters or kilometers. Including a unit of measure in your data table allows you to communicate more specifically about your measurements."
msgstr "測量單位可以使數據表更加明確。通常呎、碼或英里是美國用來測量距離的單位。使用國際單位制的國家，相同的測量單位有公分、公尺或公里。在數據表中加入測量單位可以更明確的表示你的測量數據。"

msgid "No. The patterns in the numbers on the data table can give you a clear idea about which cyclist moves fastest. Mary is moving 3 miles in the same time George moves 1 mile, so Mary is faster."
msgstr "不。數據表上數字的變化模式可以讓你明確知道哪一輛自行車最快。瑪莉移動3英里的同時，喬治只移動1英里，所以瑪莉比較快。"

msgid "Nope. At her pace, Mary will be 21 miles East at 70 minutes."
msgstr "不。依照瑪莉前進的步調，在70分鐘的時候，瑪莉到達21英里以東的位置。"

msgid "Not quite. Based on the pattern in the data table, Mary will be 24 miles East at 80 minutes."

msgstr "另一種表示運動的工具是為位置-時間的關係圖。一張圖可以更容易看到兩個物體的運動差異。這數據所繪的圖上來自先前段落中的表。"

msgid "Plotting data on a graph of position versus time makes it easier to observe patterns in motion. A graph can make it easier to see when Object A passes Object B, and which object is travelling faster. Object A, shown in blue, has a steeper line on the graph. That lets you know that it has a bigger change in position than Object B during the time shown on this graph. A steeper line on a graph of position versus time means that the object has a greater speed."
msgstr "把數據畫在位置-時間的關係圖上，可以更容易地觀察運動的模式。一張圖可以更清楚的知道物體A何時超越物體B，並且知道哪個物體一段速度較快。物體A標示為藍色，在圖上的線較陡峭。這張圖可以讓你知道，在時間內它的位置改變比物體B還大。在位置-時間的關係圖上，越陡峭的線表示速度越大。"

msgid "This graph plots the position of Object C and Object D.  The lines for the two objects appear to be parallel to each other. Based on the graph, you can see that Object D never catches up to Object C, but Object C is always the same distance ahead of Object D. During the time shown on this graph. Both objects change position by the same amount. Object C moves from the 4 meter mark to the 10 meter mark, and Object D moves from the 0 meter mark to the 6 meter mark.  That represents a change in position of 6 meters for both objects. Both objects change position by 6 meters in 60 seconds. That’s why the red line on the graph is just as steep as the green line."
msgstr "這張圖繪出了物體C和物體D的位置。兩個物體的線相互平行。根據圖示，你可以看到物體D永遠趕不上物體C，但物體C永遠領先物體D相同的距離。在此圖示意的這段期間。這張圖繪出了物體C和物體D的位置。兩個物體的線相互平行。根據圖示，你可以看到物體D永遠趕不上物體C，但物體C永遠領先物體D相同的距離。在此圖示意的這段期間。"

msgid "No.  These lines are parallel, so they’re never going to cross."
msgstr "不。這些線是平行的，所以它們永遠不會交會。"

msgid "Different patterns to an object's motion can tell us a lot about how the object is moving.  For example, in a data table like the one to the right, you can see how Terry is changing position by 7 miles every hour, similar to a slow walking pace.  Justin, however, is changing position by 7 miles every hour, similar to a fast jog.  In both examples, the pattern expressed in miles every hour is known as the <span class='key'>speed or velocity</span>.  That pattern can be used to predict the person’s position at a later time.  For example, with a velocity pattern of 3 miles every hour, Terry will have traveled 30 miles after 10 hours at that pace.  If you know that Justin’s total trip took 6 hours, you can use his velocity pattern to see that he likely travelled 42 miles.  Motion where the pattern is constant is referred to as motion with constant velocity."
msgstr "物體運動的不同模式，可以告訴我們很多關於物體如何運動的資訊。舉例來說，如表中一個向右的數據，你可以看到泰瑞如何以每小時7英里改變他的位置，如步行般緩慢的移動速度。然而賈斯汀以每小時7英里改變他的位置，如快速的跑步。在這兩個例子中，每一小時改變的英里數被稱為速率或速度。這樣的變化模式可用來預測一段時間後人的所在位置。例如以每小時3英里的速度前進，在10小時候，泰瑞走了30英里。如果你知道賈斯汀整段路程花了6小時，你可以利用他的移動速度得知他可能走了42英里。運動的形式是恆定的指的是以恆定的速率運動。"

"There are other types of motion that don’t display a constant velocity pattern.  Can you see a pattern to Sara’s motion in the table to the left?  In the first ten seconds, she changed position by 1 meter. In the next ten seconds, she changed position by 2 meters. In the ten seconds after that, she changed position by 3 meters.  Sara is getting faster!  If she continues at this pattern, can you see how she’ll be located at 28 meters at 70 seconds and at 36 meters at 80 seconds?  Where will she be at 90 seconds?  To find the answer, you have to look at what happens to the velocity pattern.  It seems that she’s increasing her velocity pattern by 1 meter every 10 seconds for every 10 seconds she’s in motion. So initially, she moves 1 meter in the first 10 seconds, then she moves 2 meters in the next 10 seconds, and then she changes her position by 3 more meters "
"the 10 seconds after that.  This pattern that describes the way the velocity pattern is changing is known as <span class='key'>acceleration</span>. "
msgstr "還有另一種不為等速度的情況。你有看到左邊表格中薩拉（Sara）的移動情形嗎？在第一個十秒鐘，她位置改變了1公尺。再下一個十秒，她位置改變了2公尺。而再之後的十秒鐘，她位置改變了3公尺。薩拉越來越快！如果她繼續依照這樣的情形下去，你知道她是如何在70秒時到達28公尺處和在80秒時到達36公尺處的嗎？為了找到答案，你必須了解在速度上發生了什麼事情。看來她以每十秒速度增加1/10（公尺/秒）的方式移動。所以一開始第一個十秒的時候，她移動了1公尺，然後接下來的10秒，她移動了2公尺，之後再過了10秒，她的位置改變了3公尺多。這種描述速度改變的方式，被稱為加速度。"
