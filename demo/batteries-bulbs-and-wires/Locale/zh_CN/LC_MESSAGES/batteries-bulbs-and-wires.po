That would be cool and scary too. No matter where you are in the dark – a flashlight makes you feel better and safer because you can see what's out there. But have you ever wondered about how they work? What makes them light up and what to do if they stop working? It all has to do with simple electric circuits so let's see if we can figure it out."

msgid "Reviewing big ideas about... electric circuits"
msgstr ""

msgid "The most fundamental concept of almost any electrical device is the idea of a <span class='key'>circuit</span>. A circuit allows <span class='key'>electrons</span>, which are tiny invisible negatively charged particles, to flow through a wire or another conductor. The <span class='key'>electric current</span> (the flowing electrons) moves from a source of electrical energy - such as a <span class='key'>battery</span> or electrical generator - to a device that needs electrical energy to operate – like a light bulb, an electric motor, or a computer chip. In sophisticated electrical devices, such as a computer, circuits can be very complex, but at its core, every complex circuit begins with a <span class='key'>simple circuit</span> composed of three basic components:<br>"

msgstr ""

msgid "Simple Electric Circuit"
msgstr ""

msgid "The term \"circuit\" comes from the same Latin language root \"circ\" - as in the word circle. When you draw a circle, you start at one point and come all the way back to it. Can you think of other words that come from that same Latin root? Even though electrical circuits might not always be in the shape of circles, the idea is that electrical current flows in a path that starts at the source of the electrical energy, flows through the circuit, and finally comes back to that source. Sometimes simple circuits can have a switch, like in the flashlight, but it isn’t absolutely necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid "Look carefully at the diagram above. You can trace the flow of electricity in the circuit. It starts by coming out of one end of the battery, flows through the wire to the side of the bulb, then through the bulb making the bulb light up, then out the bottom of the bulb and through the wire back to the battery. Flashlights are a good example of a simple circuit. Can you trace the circuit in this diagram of a flashlight?"

msgstr ""

msgid "More big ideas about... electric circuits"
msgstr ""

msgid "Electric circuits rely on electrical <span class='key'>conductors</span>, such as copper wires, to conduct electrical energy from the source to the device that needs it. Most common electrical conductors used in normal circuits are metals, such as copper, gold and silver. Interestingly, water is also a conductor even though it’s not a metal. Materials that don’t conduct electrical energy are called <span class='key'>insulators</span>. Examples of insulating materials are plastic, wood, cloth, air and many other non-metals. Insulators are sometimes used to cover and shield the conductors in a circuit so that when you touch the conductor, you don't get an electrical shock."
msgstr ""

msgid "It's important to know that getting an electrical shock can be very dangerous and could hurt you or even kill you. That's because touching the conductor allows the electrical energy to travel through your body and can make your heart stop. It's not dangerous when you touch a wire in a flashlight because the electrical energy from a flashlight battery isn't very strong. But if you touch an uninsulated wire from lamp or appliance that is plugged into your house sockets, it can be very harmful to you because the electrical energy traveling through the wires is much stronger."
msgstr ""

msgid "But even a single battery and wire can possibly hurt you a little. If you run an uninsulated wire directly from the top to the bottom of a flashlight battery, it will heat enough to burn your fingers, but it won't electrocute you. <br/> <br/> And remember!! Water is an electrical conductor too. So if you are in water, like in a bathtub, and an appliance like a hairdryer falls into the tub, the water can conduct the electrical energy from the hairdryer to your body and can hurt you or kill you. So be careful!!"

msgid "Batteries are the source of electrical energy in a flashlight circuit. Flashlight batteries usually have a top and bottom that are connected by the conductors to the light bulb to complete the circuit and make the bulb light up."
msgstr ""

msgid "But there are lots of other kinds of batteries too - like a car battery. Instead of having a top and a bottom for connections, it has two “<span class='key'>terminals</span>”, which are little posts that stick out of the top of the battery that the circuit wires are connected to."
msgstr ""

msgid "All batteries have two ends or terminals that are usually marked with a plus sign (+) or a minus sign (-). To make a circuit, a wire or other conductor connects the + side of the battery with the – side with something like a light bulb in between."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another kind of battery is the rectangular battery with two connection clips on the top that are often used to power toy cars and helicopters. And there are cell phone batteries and wristwatch batteries too. It seems like almost everything we use in our everyday lives requires some type of battery."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each of these batteries is slightly different. And they are often identified by how powerful they are. The batteries electrical energy is measured in volts. A flashlight battery is one-and-a-half (1.5) volts. So is a watch battery. A car battery is 12 volts. The battery you put in your toy car is 9 volts. The higher the voltage, the higher the electrical energy they put out. Other batteries are other voltages depending on the needs of the devices they power."
msgstr ""

msgid "So how does this battery work? Batteries contain chemicals – like acids and metals - that have chemical reactions that cause electrons – those invisible charged particles we talked about earlier - to move from one side of the battery to the other – through the wires in the circuit. Batteries are good examples of a convenient and portable system that converts <span class='key'>chemical potential energy</span> into <span class='key'>electrical energy</span>."
msgstr ""

msgid "Batteries used in your computer or cell phone are pretty complicated. But the basic idea can be as simple as sticking two different metals, like a zinc nail and a copper penny, into a lemon. These metals are called <span class='key'>electrodes</span>. Chemical reactions occur between the zinc and copper electrodes and the acid in the lemon juice to cause electrons to start to move. And if you hook up a wire between the nail and the penny – a lemon battery’s terminals - those electrons will move through the wire from the nail to the penny forming an electric current.  That’s a simple circuit! If you were to put a very small bulb or a buzzer in the circuit attached to the wire, the bulb would faintly glow or the buzzer would buzz. A lemon battery is a very simple battery that doesn't have much power. But it shows you the basic idea of how a battery works."

msgstr ""

msgid "Nope – the voltage doesn’t tell anything about how long the battery will last. Usually bigger batteries will last longer because they have more chemicals inside."
msgstr ""

msgid "Not exactly – different voltage batteries are used to power different devices but the same voltage can also power different devices. For example, a battery can be the same voltage as a battery powering a flashlight."
msgstr ""

msgid "Correct – the voltage of a battery is a measure of how much electrical energy a battery can put out. A flashlight battery is only 1.5 volts so it can’t start a car. But a car battery is 12 volts and can start a car."
msgstr "Yes – Chemical reactions inside the battery can cause electrons to move in the circuit. This electric current is what causes a bulb in the electric circuit to light up."

msgid "Not really – bulbs aren’t like people. They don’t “need” electrons so that’s not what makes the electrons flow in a circuit."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nope – wires can’t push electrons to make them move."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nope – electrons don’t build up on the terminals."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ultimate objective of an electric circuit is to power some electrical device – like a light, or a motor, or a buzzer. Let’s just look at a light bulb for now. The usual light bulb most people have in their houses is called an <span class='key'>incandescent bulb</span> – incandescent means it lights up from getting hot.  As we discussed in the beginning of this review, the electrons, or electric current, comes out of one end of the battery, flows through the wire to the side of the bulb, then through the bulb making the bulb light up, then out the bottom of the bulb and through the wire back to the battery. When we say \"through the bulb\", we mean that the electric current flows through the thin, curly little wire in the bulb, called the <span class='key'>filament</span>."
msgstr ""

msgid "It’s hard to see how the connections are made from the circuit to the filament in most light bulbs because part of the filament wire is \"hidden\" in the metal base of the bulb – the \"screw-in\" part (Figure 1). But if you could see through the metal, you'd see that one part of the filament wire is connected to the bump on the bottom of the bulb and the other to the metal side of the screw-in part of the bulb (Figure 2)."
msgstr ""

msgid "When the circuit is complete and the current runs through the filament, the <span class='key'>friction</span> or rubbing together of the electrons passing through the skinny wire of the filament causes so much friction in the wire that the wire heats up and it starts to glow and give off light. That's how a light bulb works. Try rubbing your hands together really hard and fast. Do you feel them heat up? That heat is caused by the friction of rubbing your hands together. Do you think you could rub them together hard enough to get them to glow?"

msgid "Nope – Positive and negative charges don’t crash together in the bulb."

msgid "Yes -  Electrons flowing through the filament causes friction in the filament causing it to heat up and give off light."
msgstr ""
