From bolts of lightning to static cling, many things that we see and experience in everyday life are controlled by electric charge. That's because all the objects that you interact with are made up of charged particles. We don't normally notice all of that electric charge because most objects have equal amounts of positive and negative charge. When the charge of an object gets altered, even just a little bit, the effect can be very noticeable."
msgstr "在遊樂園的溜滑梯， 可以是一個驚心動魄的體驗的原因不只一個。從閃電光束到靜電的吸附，在日常生活中，我們看到和體驗到的，皆由電荷所控制。這就是因為所有與你互動的物體都帶有電子。我們通常不會注意到「電荷」，因為大多數物體帶有相等的正電荷與負電荷。當一個物體的電荷改變，那怕是一點點，效果會是非常明顯的。"

msgid "All of the objects that we encounter in everyday life are made up of matter. Matter consists of really small particles called atoms, and those atoms are made up of even smaller particles called <span class='key'>protons</span>, <span class='key'>neutrons</span> and <span class='key'>electrons</span>. Protons carry a positive charge, and electrons carry a negative charge while neutrons carry no charge. There are more protons in the fingernail on your pinky than there are people on the Earth. However high that number may be, there are most likely the exact same number of electrons in that fingernail. Most objects have an equal number of protons and electrons. In other words, most objects are <span class='key'>electrically neutral</span>. Scientists have been studying electricity for far longer than they have known about the atomic particles. That's why they first came up with the terms positive charge and negative charge to describe what we now know as protons and electrons. If an object contains more electrons than protons, the object is said to be negatively charged. If an object contains more protons than electrons, it is said to be positively charged."
msgstr "所有我們日常生活當中會遇見的物體皆是由物質所構成。物質是由非常小的粒子「原子」所組成，而這些原子是由更小的粒子「質子、中子和電子」組成。質子帶正電，電子帶負電，而中子不帶電荷。在你的小拇指指甲上的質子相對比於地球表面上的人來的多。然而這個數字多到極有可能和在指甲上擁有的電子數一般。大多數的物體具有相同數量的質子和電子。換言之，大多數的物體為中性。科學家們一直都在研究「電」持續很長一段時間了，遠超過對原子微粒的所知。這就是為什麼他們先是想出了正電荷和負電荷來形容我們所知道的質子和電子。如果一個物體的電子比質子還多，這物體被認為帶負電。如果一個物體的質子比電子還多，這物體被認為帶正電。"

msgid "It turns out that it is relatively easy to change the number of electrons in an object, but extremely difficult to change the number of protons. For this reason, objects typically become charged because they've either gained electrons from some other object, or they've lost electrons to some other object. Scientists refer to a gain of electrons as becoming <span class='key'>negatively charged</span>, and a loss of electrons as becoming <span class='key'>positively charged</span>.  Gaining or losing protons is a much more involved process, and would mean that the material had actually changed to a different element, like turning Oxygen into Carbon."
msgstr "事實證明改變物體中電子的數量是比較容易的，但很難改變質子的數量。出於這個原因，物體帶電是因為他們從其他物體上獲得電子，或者是失去電子給其他物體。科學家指出得到電子則帶負電，失去電子則帶正電。得到或失去質子是一個更加複雜的過程，並且意味著物質實際上變成另一個不同的元素，例如把氧氣導入碳中。"

msgid "Nicely done! The rod is positively charged because some of its electrons have gone to another object."
msgstr "做得好！塑膠棒帶正電是因為它的電子跑到其他物體上了。"

msgid "Nope. It would take a great deal of energy to gain protons from another object, and that would also fundamentally change the material the rod is made out of. In this case, the rod became positively charged by losing electrons to another object."
msgstr "不。從另一個物體上得到質子需要相當大的能量，且將會改變製成塑膠棒的基本材料。"

msgid "Nope. Losing protons to another object would result in the rod becoming negatively charged. In this case, the rod became positively charged by losing electrons to another object."

msgid "More big ideas about... electric charge"
msgstr "更多有關「電荷」的大概念"

msgid "Neutral objects can gain or lose electrons in a variety of ways. One of the most common is through contact with other materials. Depending on the material an object is made out of, it may either take electrons from other objects, or it might tend to give electrons to other objects. For example, when a balloon is rubbed on human hair, the balloon tends to take electrons from the hair. This leaves the balloon with a negative charge and the hair with a positive charge. This is similar to the way in which you can charge up by shuffling your feet across a carpeted floor, or charge a comb by rubbing it with a silk cloth."
msgstr "中性的物體可以藉著各種方式得到電子或失去電子。最常見的是透過接觸其他材質。一個物體可能會從其他物體得到電子或是失去電子給其他物體是取決於物體的材質。例如，單一個氣球在頭髮上摩擦，氣球會從頭髮獲得電子。這使氣球帶負電和頭髮將帶正電荷。這類似於雙腳在地毯上磨擦滑行產生電（靜電）或是用絲巾摩擦梳子使梳子帶電。"

msgid "The type of charge an object will take can be determined by consulting a chart called the <span class = 'key'>triboelectric series</span>.  This chart identifies materials by their tendency to either lose electrons or gain electrons, in comparison to other materials.  An object listed near the top of the chart at right tends to lose electrons and become positively charged.  A material listed near the bottom of the chart is more likely to gain electrons and become negatively charged.  For example, if you rubbed a nylon rod with a polyester cloth, the nylon would lose electrons to the polyester resulting in a positive charge for the nylon rod and a negative charge for the polyester.  However, if a neutral piece of polyester was rubbed on a vinyl rod, the polyester would become positively charged, and the vinyl would be negatively charged.  This is because vinyl is located closer to the negative end of the chart and polyester is relatively closer to the positive end."
msgstr "物體所帶電荷的類型可查閱摩擦電序表。此圖表標示了這材質相較於其他材質失去和獲得電子的傾向。列在右方靠近圖表頂端的物體傾向於失去電子且帶正電荷。列在靠近圖表底部的材質是較易獲得電子而帶負電荷。例如，如果用不織布摩擦尼龍棒，尼龍棒會失去電子跑到不織布上而帶正電荷，且不織布會帶負電荷。但如果一塊中性的聚酯纖維（塑膠）摩擦聚氯乙烯棒，塑膠塊會帶正電荷，聚氯乙烯棒會帶負電荷。這是因為，聚氯乙烯更靠近圖表的負端，聚酯纖維（塑膠）比較接近正端。"

By touching other objects to the metal dome, they too can become positively charged. You may have seen images like the one below of a person's hair standing on end.

msgid "Charged objects exert forces on each other. The amount of force depends upon the amount of charge, as well as how close the objects are to each other. The direction of the force depends upon the types of charge involved. When a positively charged object is held near a negatively charged object, the two objects will experience an attractive force that attempts to bring the objects closer together. However, if a positively charged object is held near another positively charged object, both objects will experience a repulsive force that attempts to push the objects farther away from each other. You'll get the same outcome if you attempt to hold two negatively charged objects near each other. This principle is often stated as \"opposites attract, likes repel\". Take a look at the picture of the person touching the Van de Graaff generator. The person, and all of the hairs on her head have become positively charged. Since all of the hairs have the same charge, they are repelling each other, causing them to stand on end."
msgstr "但是如果帶正電的物體靠近另一個帶正電的物體，兩個物體會產生一個排斥的力，試圖將彼此推離。如果試圖將兩個帶負電的物體靠近彼此也將會得到同樣的結果。這就是我們經常說的「同性相斥，異性相吸」的原則。帶電物體會對彼此施力。而力的大小取決於電荷的量以及物體彼此接近的程度。力的方向取決於所帶電荷的種類。當帶正電的物體靠近帶負電荷的物體，兩個物體會有一個吸引的力，試圖將彼此拉得更靠近。來看看一個人觸摸范德格拉夫起電機的照片。這個人和她所有的頭髮都會變成帶正電荷。因為所有的毛髮都帶有相同的電荷，它們會相互排斥導致豎立。"

msgid "The force due to electric charge is responsible for holding together all of the objects around you. Charge-based interactions are responsible for the bonds that hold together solid objects like the tables and chairs in your classroom. Without this force, you would simply pass right through your chair and end up on the floor. An easy way to see this force at work is to slowly fill a glass with water. The interactions between the water molecules allow you to actually overfill the glass slightly. The surface tension will hold the molecules together and prevent them from flowing down the sides of the glass."
msgstr "力乃是由於電荷而負責來維繫你身邊的所有物體吸引在一起。電荷本身的交互作用是負責連結固態物體的鍵結，就像教室中的書桌與椅子一樣。如果沒有這個力，你會直接穿過你的椅子，最後直接坐到地板上。一種簡單可以看到這股力量作用的方法是慢慢填充玻璃杯中的水。水分子之間的相互作用讓你使玻璃杯中的水略滿出來。表面張力會使水分子抓在一起，防止它們從玻璃杯的側面流下。"

"Lightning storms are one of nature’s most dramatic spectacles.  These storms can be both fascinating displays of natural beauty, as well as frightening and dangerous.  A lightning strike can cause severe damage to large objects like forests or homes, and can cause severe injury or death for animals.  Scientists disagree as to the exact method by which the clouds become charged, but it seems that it is likely related to the vertical movement of water droplets within the clouds.  This tends to leave the bottom of the cloud negatively charged, and the upper part of the cloud positively charged.  When the electric charge becomes great enough, a cloud can get rid of the excess charge by sending a stream of electrons to another cloud, or to the ground.  This stream of particles causes the air to give off light, and causes the air to heat up so rapidly that it produces a shockwave that we hear as thunder.  Lightning is a very common occurrence.  At any given moment, there are on average just under 50 lightning strikes per second occurring on Earth.  There’s an old yarn that lightning never strikes the same spot twice, but according to records, the Empire State building was once struck eight times in less than half an hour.  Lightning strikes are so dangerous because they contain a large amount of energy.  Even a small lightning carries enough energy "

msgid "Summarizing big ideas about... electric charge"
msgstr "總結有關「電荷」的大概念"

msgid "All of the objects that you see around you are made up of <span class=key>electrons</span>, <span class=key>neutrons</span> and <span class=key>protons</span>. Electrons and protons are the particles that carry electric charge. In most objects, the number of protons and the number of electrons is exactly the same, so those objects are said to be <span class=key>electrically neutral </span>.  Charge can be separated by touching different materials, like silk and vinyl, together and peeling them apart.  Only electrons are exchanged in this way, exchanging protons requires a much greater amount of energy.  Charged particles exert forces on one another with like charge particles pushing away from each other with a repulsive force, and opposite charges attracting.  These forces due to electric charge are responsible for holding together all of the objects that make up the world around you. Several of the most dramatic light shows in nature are based on charged particles. Lightning strikes occur when a large buildup of electrons at the base of a cloud jump to another cloud or to the Earth's surface. The Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) and Aurora Australis (Southern Lights) are the result of charged particles interacting with the Earth's magnetic field and energizing gases in the atmosphere, causing beautiful displays of color in the night sky."
msgstr "圍繞在你身邊的所有物體都是以電子、質子和中子所構成。電子和質子是帶有電荷的粒子。大部分的物體，電子數和質子數是完全相同的，因此這些物體被認為是為電中性。電荷可透過接觸不同材質被分配在一起或是分開，像是絲綢與聚氯乙烯。只有電子交換是以這種方式，質子交換需要更大的能量。帶電粒子彼此施加壓力，如粒子彼此推開的排斥力與相反電荷的吸引力。這些因電荷所產生的力負責維繫你周圍的所有物體。在自然界中幾種最戲劇性的燈光秀根據帶電粒子所產生的。閃電發生於當雲的基部累積大量的電子跳到另一個雲朵或地球表面。北極光與南極光是由帶電粒子、地球磁場與大氣中的激發氣體相互作用結果，在夜空中產生美麗的顏色。"
