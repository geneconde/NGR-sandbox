msgid "Objects all around you are interacting with one another. These interactions can cause objects to stay still, or they can affect the object in ways that can be identified by looking for patterns in the object's motion. Often, objects are experiencing interactions with several other things at the same time. These interactions can be described based on different types of forces. Forces can be really small, like the weight of a butterfly resting on your shoulder, or they can be huge like the thrust from a rocket carrying astronauts into space."
msgstr "你身邊的所有物件都相互作用著。這些交互作用會使物體停留在原地，或是它們能影響可被觀察辨識的運動模式。通常，物體都經歷著在同一時間與多個其他物體交互作用。這些交互作用可以被描述成是基於不同種類的力所產生。力可以是非常小的，像是蝴蝶停在你的肩膀的重量，或是他們可以大到像火箭把太空人帶到外太空的推力。"

msgstr "複習相關的大概念……牛頓第三運動定律"

msgid "<span class='key'>Forces</span> are most easily thought of as a push or a pull, but objects don’t need to be in motion in order to be experiencing forces. Even when objects are sitting perfectly still, they are likely to be experiencing forces from any other objects that they are in contact with. Contact between objects is one of the clearest indicators that forces are present. Look at the interaction between the boys and the trampoline in the image below. Not only are the boys experiencing a force from the trampoline, keeping them from falling to the ground, but the trampoline is experiencing a force from the boys, causing it to stretch underneath them."
msgstr "力大多容易的被想像成是推或拉，但是物體並不需要動作才能感受力。就算物體完美的座落著不動，他們還是像感受著其他任何與他們相互連接物體的力。物體間的接觸是力呈現於其中的一個明顯指標。請看下方圖中男孩們與跳床之間的交互作用。不只是男孩們感受到來自跳床的力，這讓他們不會掉落到地上，然而跳床受到來自男孩們的力，這造成跳床在他們的下方伸展。"

msgid "Although we don't notice it quite so easily, a similar interaction is occurring between this flower pot and table. The table is preventing the flower pot from crashing into the ground below, and the flower pot is causing the boards in the table to bend ever so slightly underneath it."
msgstr "雖然我們沒有那麼容易注意到它，但是有一個相似的交互作用正發生在花瓶與桌子之間。桌子正避免讓花瓶掉到下方的地板而破碎，而花瓶使得桌板微微地向下彎曲。"

msgid "More big ideas about... Newton's Third Law"
msgstr "更多相關的大概念……牛頓第三運動定律"

msgid "<span class='key'>Newton's Third Law</span> is commonly stated as \"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\" Another way to think of it is \"If object A puts a force on object B, then object B puts a force on object A.\" This is to say that there are no isolated forces in nature, forces always occur in pairs. When the baseball player strikes a ball with a bat, there is a force on the ball by the bat as well as a force on the bat due to the ball. This interaction can cause the ball to go flying over the fence for a home run, and a stinging feeling in the hands of the batter."
msgstr "牛顿第三定律通常表述为 “对于每一个动作，有一个大小相等，方向相反的反作用力。” 另一种方式来思考的是 “如果对象A把力对象B ，那么对象B把力对象答： “这是说，没有孤立的力量在自然界中，始终势力成对出现。当棒球运动员击中了蝙蝠一球，还有由蝙蝠球以及对蝙蝠的力的力，由于球。这种相互作用会导致球去飞越篱笆的一个本垒打，并在面糊手中的刺痛感。"

msgid "Sometimes it can be a bit difficult to identify both of the forces involved in an interaction. It’s pretty obvious that a hammer is exerting force on a nail, pounding it into a board, but the nail is also putting a force on the hammer, causing it to stop moving. If the nail didn’t stop the hammer, you’d have to stop it all by yourself. Your arm would get tired much more quickly!"
msgstr "有时，它可以是一个有点难以辨认两者参与的互动力量。这是很明显，锤力施加在钉子上，冲击成一个板，但指甲也将在锤子的力量，使其停止移动。如果指甲没有停止锤子，你必须停止它全部由自己。你的手臂会觉得厌烦更迅速！"

msgid "When the soccer player heads the ball, the soccer player puts a force on the ball, and the ball also puts a force back on the soccer player. You can see in the photo how much the ball gets squished in this interaction. According to Newton’s Third Law, not only does the ball put a force on the player’s head, but that force is just as big as the force the head puts on the ball."
msgstr "当足球运动员负责的球，足球运动员把球的力，球也使力回到了足球运动员。您可以在照片多少球被压扁在这种互动中所看到的。根据牛顿第三定律，不仅球把玩家的脑袋给力，但这种力量是一样大的头把球的力量。"

msgid "Pushing slowly..."
msgstr "輕輕的推……"

msgid "Not only do forces always come in pairs, but the sizes of the two forces will always be equal. This can be tough to see because force is not the only thing that affects how much an object’s motion will change. The <span class='key'>mass</span> of the object determines how much the motion will change for a particular amount of force.  Mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and is simply a measure of how much matter makes up an object. It’s easy to push the empty shopping cart when you first get to the grocery store, but as the cart fills up with groceries, it becomes more massive.  When the cart is full, it becomes harder to change the cart’s motion. It’s harder to get the cart to start moving, harder to stop it once it's in motion, and harder to get it to go around corners. <span class='key'>Acceleration</span> is a term used to describe how quickly an object’s motion changes. For a certain amount of force, an object with more mass will have less acceleration, and an object with less mass will have a greater acceleration."
msgstr "不只力出現時都會成對，而且這兩個力的大小總是都會相同。因為力不是唯一影響物體運動如何改變的因素，所以很難被看到。物體的質量決定它受到一個特定的力時的運動改變。質量的測量以公斤為單位（kg）且單純地去測量由多少物質組成此物體。當你進到超市時可以輕易地推動空的購物車，但是當被雜貨所填滿時，它會變得沈重。當整車都滿時，會變得更難讓車子運動。變得更難推動起步，更難在它移動中停下它，且更難讓它在轉角轉彎。加速度這個詞被用來描述物體移動速度的變化。以一定量的力來說，較大質量的物體會有較小的加速度，而質量較小的物體會有較大的加速度。"

msgid "When two objects interact, they put equal forces on each other, but their accelerations will also depend upon their masses. If one of the objects is two times more massive than the other, the more massive object will experience half as much acceleration as the lighter object. This can make it difficult to understand that the forces they put on each other are always equal in size. Did you know that when you jump off the ground, you push down on the earth with the same amount of force that it pushes up on you?  This might be hard to believe because we don’t see the earth move. The reason for that is not a difference in forces but a huge difference between your mass and the mass of the earth. If the two objects involved in an interaction have the same amount of mass, it’s easy to see that the forces they exert on each other are equal size because the accelerations will be the same size, too!"
msgstr "當兩個物體交互作用，它們相互施予相同的力，但是它們的加速度還是依各自的質量而定。如果有一個物體的質量是另一個的質量，質量較大者會受到質量較小者一半量的加速度。這會令人難以理解它們施給對方的力是一樣大的。你是否知道當你跳到地面時，你施給地球向下的推力和地球給你向上的推力，是一樣大的嗎？這或許很難相信，因為我們並沒有看到地球移動。這是因為兩者所受的力並沒有不同，但是你與地球的質量卻有極大的差異。如果兩個物體涉入交互作用且擁有相同的質量，這樣就會比較容易理解它們所施予對方的力大小相同，因為它們的加速度也是相同的！"

msgid "Did you know that people used to be skeptical about the ability to launch rockets into space beyond the earth's atmosphere? They were concerned that the lack of air would make it impossible for the rockets to exert forces in order to control their orbital paths. It turns out that rockets take advantage of Newton's Third Law force pairs by pushing the burning rocket fuel backwards. The other part of that force pair is the force of the burning rocket fuel pushing forward on the rocket, allowing the rocket to change its motion."

msgid "For any interaction between objects, the <span class='key'>forces</span> the objects put on each other will be of the same size and in opposite directions. Often stated as 'For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction,' this is known as <span class='key'>Newton's Third Law</span> of motion. To put it another way, there are no isolated forces in nature; forces always come in pairs. When you push on the ground to walk, there is a corresponding force that the ground puts on you. When you use a hammer to pound a nail into a board, the nail also puts a force back on the hammer. When a rocket pushes burning fuel backwards, there is a force in the forward direction to move the rocket. However, paired forces don't guarantee that the changes in motion for the two objects will be paired. The <span class='key'>acceleration</span> of an object is also based on how massive the object is. For an object that is ten times as massive, the acceleration will be ten times smaller even though the forces the two objects experience are the same. If the two objects involved in the interaction are similar in <span class='key'>mass</span>, then it is likely that you will see similar changes in motion."
msgstr "對任何物體之間的交互作用來說，力與物體推向對方會有相同大小且反方向的力。通常被描述為“對於每一個動作，會有一個相同且反向的交互作用”這就被稱為牛頓第三運動定律。換一種方式來說，在自然界中並沒有獨立的力存在；力總是成對出現。當你走路時推向地面，那裡就會有一個相對應的力從地面推向你。當你用一個錘子將釘子鎚進木板裡，釘子也會對鎚子施予一個力。當一個火箭燃燒燃料向後推，那會有一個向前的力來推動火箭。但是，成對的力並不能確保兩個物體的運動改變也會是成對的。物體的加速度也是依據物體的質量而定。假設有十倍的質量，這時就算兩個物體受到相同的力它的加速度也會小十倍。如果兩個質量相近的物體發生交互作用，那你就會看到它們會有類似的運動改變。"

msgid "Reviewing key vocabulary related to... Newton's Third Law"
msgstr "複習相關的關鍵字……牛頓第三運動定律"

msgid "Force"
msgstr "力"

msgid "A force occurs anytime there is an interaction between two objects.  Both the size and the direction of the force will determine how that force affects the motion of the objects."
msgstr "兩個物體交互作用時隨時都有力的產生。力的大小和方向會決定力對物體運動狀態的影響。"

msgid "Acceleration"
msgstr "加速度"

msgid "Acceleration is how quickly an object changes speed.  If an object is speeding up or slowing down, it is accelerating."
msgstr "加速度是指物體速度的變化。如果有個物體正在加速或是減速，這就是加速度。"

msgid "Mass"
msgstr "質量"

msgid "A measure of an object’s inertia as well as the effect gravity has upon it. An object with more mass will require more force to accelerate it and will feel a greater force of gravity upon it."
msgstr "測量一個物體的慣性就像它所受到的重力。一個物體有越大的質量則需要越大的的力才能為它加速，且會感受到它有更大的重力。"

msgid "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When a force is applied to an object, that object applies the exact same amount of force back on whatever applied it in the exact opposite direction. So if a person was to push a boulder across a field, the boulder would push back with the same force that the person pushed it with."
msgstr "對於每個動作，會有一個相等且反向的反應。當供給物體一個力，那物體會供給一個相等量且相反方向的力。所以如果一個人推一個大石頭通過原野，石頭會對這個人施予相同的力。"

msgstr "你懂了！兩個男孩所集合的力可以對一隻狗的運動造成很大改變。這男孩自己試著要讓這兩隻狗加速，產生一些運動的改變。"

msgid "Not quite. The combined forces of two boys pulling will be greater than the force of one boy pulling on his own, but the mass of two dogs in the wagon will resist the change in motion greater than the mass of one dog in the wagon, and an empty wagon will provide the least resistance to a change in motion."
msgstr "不盡然。兩個男孩所集合拉動的力會比一個男孩獨自拉動來得大，但是貨車上的兩隻狗的質量會抗拒只有一隻狗的貨車所產生的運動改變，且空的貨車會對運動改變有最少的抗拒。"

msgid "Not quite.  The forces are equal in size and opposite in direction, but the hammer puts a force on the nail in a downward direction, and the nail puts a force on the hammer in an upward direction."
msgstr "不盡然。這些力大小相同且方向相反，但是錘子對釘子施予一個向下的力，且釘子向錘子施予一個向上的力。"

msgid "You got it! Anytime two objects put forces on each other, those forces are the same size and opposite in direction."
msgstr "你懂了！任何時候兩個物體相互施力時，那些力會有相同大小、相反方向。"

msgid "Nope. Even though we tend to focus on the force of the hammer hitting the nail, the nail also puts a force on the hammer. That's the force that stops the motion of the hammer. Without that force, you’d have to use the muscles in your arm to stop the hammer with every swing. You'd wear yourself out pretty quickly, if that was the case."
msgstr "沒有。就算我們傾向注意錘子打釘子的力上，釘子一樣會對鎚子施予力。那就是停止錘子運動的力。如果沒有那個力，每次揮動時你便需要用你手臂上的肌肉來停止錘子。如果是這樣的話你會很快讓自己磨損。"

msgid "Your friend is having a hard time understanding how to apply Newton's Third Law of paired forces. As an example, he describes a horse pulling a cart. He claims that it would be impossible for the horse to move the cart forward if the horse and cart are putting the same amount of force on each other. Which of the following statements would be more in line with Newton's Third Law of paired forces?"
msgstr "你的朋友在理解牛頓第三運動定律中力成對時遇到困難。舉例來說，他描述馬拉車子。他宣稱如果馬和車子向對方施予相同大小的力，可以讓馬把車向前移動。下方哪一個狀況會更符合牛頓第三運動定律中成對的力？"

msgid "To move forward, the horse puts a force on the cart which is larger than the force the cart puts on the horse."
msgstr "為了向前移動，馬施予車子的力會大於車子向馬施的力。"

msgid "To move forward, the horse must put a force on the cart which is greater than the weight of the cart."
msgstr "為了向前移動，馬必須施予比車子重的力在車子上。"

msgid "To move forward, the horse and cart put forces on each other which are equal in size."
msgstr "為了向前移動，馬與車子必須互相施予相同大小的力。"

msgid "To move forward, for a brief time the force of the horse on the cart is greater than the force of the cart on the horse."
msgstr "為了向前移動，短時間內馬對車的力會大於車對馬的力。"

msgid "Nope. It's impossible for the horse to put more force on the cart than the cart puts on the horse. Those forces are paired, so they’ll be the same size every time."
msgstr "不對。馬對車的力大於車對馬的力是有可能的。"

msgid "Nope. The force we think of as weight acts in a downward direction, the pull of the horse acts in a sideways direction. The cart can actually be moved with a force much smaller than the weight of the cart."
msgstr "不對。我們思考重量的施力是向下的，而馬拉車則是側向的。車子確實可以用比車子重量小很多的力來移動。"

msgid "Yes!  The forces that the cart and the horse put on each other will be the same size.  The horse is able to get things moving by pushing off against the ground with a lot of force."
msgstr "是。車子與馬相互施予的力會是一樣大的。馬可以藉由用很多力推向地面來讓東西移動。"

msgid "Not quite.  The forces that the cart and the horse put on each other are paired, so even if the horse tries to increase the force that it puts on the cart, the paired force that the cart puts on the horse will always increase to match it!"
msgstr "不完全。車與馬對對方所施的力是成對的，所以就算馬嘗試增加力量對車子的力，車子對馬成對的力也會來相對應增加。"
