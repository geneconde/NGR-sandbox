msgstr "複習主要概念有關於……我們周遭的空氣"

msgid "Because the mixture of gases in the air around us is invisible, some people think that there's nothing there. In fact, air is a substance that has mass and takes up space. You may recall the three common phases of matter include solid, liquid and gas. The air in earth's <span class='key'>atmosphere</span> contains a mixture of gases including mostly nitrogen, oxygen, argon and carbon dioxide."
msgstr "因為在我們週遭混合的氣體是看不見的，有些人可能會覺得它們並不存在。事實上，空氣是一種實體，它具有質量且佔有空間。你可以回想物質共通的三相，包含固態、液態、氣態。在地球上的氣體的混合包含了大多數的氮氣、氧氣、氬氣與二氧化碳。"

msgid "In addition, water (in its gaseous phase which is frequently referred to as <span class='key'>water vapor</span>) is found in Earth's atmosphere. And, despite the amount of rain, snow and sleet that you have watched fall from above, the concentration of water vapor is relatively low. There are a number of other gases such as neon, hydrogen, helium, and methane but these are found at very low levels of concentration."
msgstr "此外，水（在它的氣態經常被稱作是水蒸氣）存在於地球的大氣中。還有，除了雨、雪和冰雹你都看過之外，對於水蒸氣的濃度應該是相對較低的。還有數種其它的氣體像是氖、氫、氦和甲烷，但是它們的濃度都是非常低的。"

msgid "Although the air around us is largely invisible, air does have mass. For example, consider a balance beam that has one rubber balloon on each side. If one balloon is inflated by blowing it up using your lungs and the other balloon is left empty, then the side with the inflated balloon will be heavier than the other. That's because the mixture of oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide expelled by your lungs has mass."
msgstr "雖然在我們週遭的空氣大多數是看不到的，但是空氣確實有質量。舉例來說，想想看要在一個秤樑的兩端各放一個氣球來平衡。如果其中一個氣球用你的肺部吹滿了空氣而另一個氣球依舊是空的，接著會發現吹氣的氣球那一側會比另一端重。那是因為從你肺部所吹出來混合了氧氣、氮氣與二氧化碳的空氣是具有質量的。"

msgstr "更多主要概念有關……我們周遭的空氣"

msgid "Many of the complex phenomena that take place in Earth's atmosphere can be explained through an understanding of density and what happens when the density of an air mass changes as a result of changes in temperature and pressure."
msgstr "許多發生在地球大氣層的複雜現象，可以用當空氣質量密度改變會造成溫度與壓力改變的知識來解釋。"

msgid "Pressure"
msgstr "壓力"

msgid "Temperature"
msgstr "溫度"

msgid "Density"
msgstr "密度"

msgid "<span class='key'>Density</span> is the ratio between the amount of matter found in a given quantity of an object and the amount of space that quantity takes up (its volume). How many molecules of air packed into a certain space is what we refer to as the density of air. The density of fluids such as liquids and gases can change in response to changes in temperature and pressure. Even slight decreases in temperature can lead to significant changes in air density. For example, a helium-filled balloon brought from a warm, inside room to the cold outdoors, will quickly look deflated (less filled). This is because the density of helium inside the balloon increases as the gas is cooled by the cold outside air. Consequently, the helium takes up less space inside the balloon so the volume of the balloon is less and the balloon shrinks. This makes the balloon appear more deflated than when it was in a warm room."
msgstr "密度是指物質的量和空間的量（它的體積）之間的比例。在一個特定空間內有多少空氣分子是我們所指的空氣密度。流體例如液體與氣體的密度會隨著溫度與壓力的改變而變化。就算溫度只有微小的降低也可以造成空氣密度明顯的變化。舉例來說，一個在溫暖處充滿氦氣的氣球，從室內到寒冷的室外時會快速的消氣（比較不飽滿）。這是因為氣球裡的氦氣密度受到室外冷空氣降溫時密度增加了。所以，氦氣減少了在氣球中所佔據的空間，所以氣球的體積變小而氣球就縮小了。這會讓氣球比在溫暖的房間時顯得更小。"

msgid "Let's look at another example to better explain this. Have you ever opened a freezer door and watched the fog apparently roll out – especially on a warm humid day?"
msgstr "讓我來看其他可以解釋這個現象更好的例子。你曾打開一個冰櫃的門然後看到明顯的霧氣滾出來－特別是在溫暖且潮濕的天氣？"

msgid "You might have thought that fog inside the freezer simply flowed out when the door was opened. But this isn't what happens at all. What is actually happening is, when you open the freezer door and cold air from the freezer mixes with and cools the warmer air outside the freezer, the water molecules in the warmer air condense from cooling. That means they come together to form tiny droplets that look like fog. Though we can't see cold air flowing, we can observe its movement outward and downward as the process of condensation expands over a larger volume of air."
msgstr "你可能會認為霧氣是在冰櫃中在你打開門時流洩出來。但事實上並不是這樣發生的。事實上是這樣的，當你打開冰櫃的門然後冰櫃中的冷空氣會與冰櫃外暖空氣混合並將其降溫，在暖空氣的水分子就會因為降溫而凝結。這表示它們聚集在一起形成為看起來像霧的微小水滴。所以我們看不到冷空氣的流動，我們可以觀察到它的移動向外、向下，這就是一個較大量空氣凝結擴散的過程。"

msgid "This is one of the amazing phenomena that result from the complex interaction between the gasses in the air and the physical conditions (such as temperature and pressure) that take place throughout the air around us."
msgstr "這樣一個令人驚奇的現象，發生在我們周遭的空氣，是因空氣中的氣體與物理條件（例如溫度及壓力）複雜交互作用的結果。"

msgid "The force of gravity pulls all objects that have mass toward Earth's center. Air molecules have mass so they too are pulled down toward Earth's surface. And, just as with all objects, there is a relationship between the mass of the object and the force exerted by gravity – the greater the mass, the greater the gravitational force. The result of this gravitational pull is a phenomenon called <span class='key'>Air Pressure</span>. Imagine for a moment standing in the middle of a column of air that extends from your feet (on Earth's surface) to the outer extent of the atmosphere.  The mass of all that air directly above you exerts a force on you called air pressure.  This is a consequence of the gravitational pull of the Earth on the air mass above you and it affects you and everything on the Earth’s surface. It follows that if there are less molecules of air in that column, then the pressure would be less on Earth's surface. Conversely, if the number and mass of molecules increases, one would experience increased pressure at Earth's surface. So the higher you go, like climbing up a mountain or flying up in an airplane, the less air mass is above you which means there is less force from the weight of that air pushing down; less air pressure! Because the density of air decreases as altitude increases, air pressure generally decreases with altitude. Similarly, as the density of the air increases, so does the air pressure."
msgstr "重力會讓所有具有質量的物體移向地球的中心。空氣分子有質量所以它們也會被拉向地球的表面。還有，就像其他所有物體一樣，物體質量與重力所產生的力之間是有關係的－越大的質量，會有越大的重力。這種引力所造成的現象稱為大氣壓力。想像著在一瞬間當你站立著，從腳（地球表面）延伸出來到大氣層之外的空氣柱間。這些所有在你之上的空氣質量對你產生的力被稱為空氣壓力。這是地球對在你身體以上的空氣質量的引力所造成的結果，它也影響著地表上的所有東西。如果在這個空氣柱中的空氣分子越少，就會使地表上所受到的空氣壓力較小。相反的，如果分子的數量與質量增加的話，在地表上所感受到的壓力也會增加。所以你到越高的地方，像是登山或是搭上飛機升空，你上方的空氣質量減少了也代表有較少的空氣重力向下；有較小的空氣壓力！因為海拔上升時空氣密度下降，一般空氣壓力隨著海拔上升而減少。同理，當空氣密度下降，空氣壓力也會下降。"

msgid "You should now know that the air close to Earth’s surface contains gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide and argon as well as water vapor.  The amount of water that the atmosphere holds is influenced by its temperature. Warmer air, for example, can hold more water than cooler air. On warm days when there is a lot of moisture in the air, the air can feel very humid. As the air cools down as it rises to a higher altitude near mountains, or following a dramatic drop in temperature as the sun begins to set, the air can no longer hold as much water. Under such conditions, the water in the air condenses and it begins to precipitate as rain, snow, or sleet."
msgstr "你現在應該知道在地球表面附近的氣體包含有氮氣、氧氣、二氧化碳、氬氣以及其它例如水氣。大氣層中水氣所含有的量受到溫度的影響。在較溫暖的空氣中，舉例來說，水氣的含量會比冷空氣還多。在一個溫暖的日子當空氣中有很多濕氣時，就可以感覺到空氣很潮濕。在靠近山的地方，空氣溫度會隨著海拔上升而下降，或是隨著太陽將要下山時溫度急遽的下降，那空氣中就無法繼續保有這麼多的空氣。在這樣的狀況下，空氣中的水氣會凝結且會開始降水像是雨、雪或是冰雹。"

msgid "In addition to holding water, the atmosphere also absorbs <span class='key'>pollutants</span> - gases and small particles emitted by natural hazards such as volcanic eruptions and natural forest fires or human activity such as burning debris or industrial activities associated with generating electricity or manufacturing goods. Pollutants in the air can have a negative impact on human health as well as the environment. For example, asthma is a chronic and very often debilitating disease of the lungs caused by air pollution from cars, power plants and industrial manufacturing."
msgstr "除了要保留水份，大氣層也會吸收污染物－氣體與微小的粒子由天然災害所產生，像是火山爆發和天然森林火災；或是人為活動，像是燃燒垃圾；或是工業行為，像是與發電或是製造業相關的活動。空氣中的污染物會對人類健康與環境造成負面的衝擊。舉例來說，氣喘是一種慢性的且會使人變得非常衰弱的肺部疾病，是由汽車、發電廠與製造工業的污染所造成。"

msgid "People suffering from asthma have trouble breathing and engaging in even simple activities such as walking. Another example is found in lead. Lead is a metal that can enter the atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels. Once in the atmosphere, lead can be transported by wind and rain to places far away from the source of pollution. When humans ingest (eat) plants and animals that have been contaminated by lead pollution they can suffer from diseases that affect the brain and nervous system."
msgstr "受到氣喘折磨的人們在呼吸和從事例如走路這樣簡單的活動時，都會有困難。另一個案例是鉛。鉛是一種金屬，它來自於石化燃料的燃燒後進到大氣之中。只要一出現在大氣中，鉛就可以隨著風和雨來傳遞到距離污染源很遠的地方。當人類攝取（吃）被鉛污染過的植物與動物，他們就可能會受到影響大腦與神經系統的疾病所折磨。"
