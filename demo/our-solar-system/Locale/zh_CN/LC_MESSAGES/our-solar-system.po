msgid "Thinking about... our solar system"
msgstr "思考關於「我們的太陽系」"

msgid "For thousands of years, people have looked at the sun, moon, stars and planets. Tales were told and myths were created to explain the movement of those objects across the nighttime and daytime sky. And the patterns they found were used to create calendars and make predictions of all sorts. Today, much has been learned about the structure of the solar system and how it works. We also know that the movement of the Sun, Earth and Moon can explain phenomena on Earth such as changing tides and seasons as well as solar and lunar eclipses."
msgstr "幾千年來，人們望著太陽、月亮、星星和行星。民間傳說與神話，說明黑夜至白天星體們的移動。他們找尋其中的規律，創造曆法，並且預測種種事物。如今，已了解太陽系的結構與運作模式。我們亦知道，太陽、地球與月亮的運動可解釋地球上的各種現象，如潮汐變化、季節及日蝕和月蝕。"

msgid "Our solar system consists of a single star, which we call the Sun and eight planets including Mercury, Venus, Earth (the one we live on), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Of all the objects in our solar system, mankind has only been able to directly explore two (except for those objects such as meteorites that have fallen to Earth). The first is our planet, Earth. The second is Earth's moon. However, scientists have developed a number of tools and technologies that help them understand many details about the composition and structure of the planets that cannot yet be visited by humans. These tools and technologies include robots (sent to Mars) and unmanned spacecraft (probes) that can take pictures and atmospheric samplings and send them back to Earth."
msgstr "我們的太陽系是由我們所稱恆星之太陽與八大行星組成，包括水星、金星、地球（我們生活的地方）、火星、木星、土星、天王星和海王星。在太陽系中的星體，人類也只不過探索了兩個（除了那些降落至地球的隕石之外）。首先是我們的星球，地球。第二個是月球。然而，科學家們開發了許多工具和技術，幫助他們了解人類尚無法實地走訪之星球的組成與結構細節。這些工具和技術包括機器人（發送到火星）與無人太空船（探頭），可以拍照與大氣採樣，並將它們送回至地球。"

msgid "Reviewing big ideas about... our solar system"
msgstr "回顧有關「太陽系」之大概念。"

msgid "We can see many objects in the nighttime (and daytime) sky. Some of those objects are part of our solar system while others are not (such as distant stars). And yet others are only occasionally found in our <span class='key'>solar system</span>. Objects that are permanent residents of our solar system include the <span class='key'>Sun</span>, <span class='key'>planets</span>, <span class='key'>moons</span>, <span class='key'>asteroids</span> and <span class='key'>dwarf planets</span>. Pluto is a well-known example of a dwarf planet. All the objects in our solar system are bound together by the strong gravitational pull of the sun. Even the furthest planets in our solar system are held in their orbital paths by the sun's gravity."
msgstr "我們可以在夜空（和白天）看到許多星體。其中一些星體為我們太陽系的一部分，而有些則否（如遙遠的恆星）。還有一些則是偶爾在我們的太陽系中發現。在我們太陽系中永久的星體，包括太陽、行星、衛星、小行星和矮行星。冥王星是一顆矮行星著名的例子。所有在我們的太陽系中的星體是被太陽強大的引力聚在一起。即使是太陽系最遙遠的行星，也因太陽的引力而保持在自己的軌道上運行。"

msgid "Most of the objects we see with our naked eyes in the nighttime sky that are outside our solar system are stars. <span class='key'>Comets</span> are frozen bodies of ice and dust that spend most of their time outside our solar system. However, some comets follow orbits around our Sun. The Sun's <span class='key'>gravity</span> is the force that pulls them inside our solar system. As comets approach the Sun, a bright tail forms making them visible in the nighttime sky. Sometimes, the comets are so big and bright that they can be seen during the daytime. Scientists argue comets of all sizes (large and small) that have crashed into Earth are the source of water found on our planet. Collectively, most of the objects we see in the day and nighttime sky are all found in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way Galaxy. There is some variation in the way scientists define <span class='key'>galaxy</span>, but most agree that it is a massive collection of stars (many billions) held together by the force of gravity."
msgstr "我們夜晚大多數能以肉眼看到的星體為太陽系以外的恆星。彗星為冰和塵埃的冷凍體，大部分時間存在於太陽系之外。然而，一些彗星遵循軌道，環繞著太陽運行。太陽的地心引力在我們的太陽系中是一股往內拉的力量。當彗星靠近太陽，在夜晚的天空可以看到會彗星會出現一個明亮的尾巴。有時，彗星大到能在白天見到。科學家認為各種大小不同的彗星撞擊地球，是地球上水的起源。總體來說，所有我們在白天及夜晚天空中看到的星體都是位於銀河系的獵戶臂。科學家對銀河系或許有些不同，但大多數都同意銀河是由恆星大量匯集而成（數十億）。"

msgid "The Sun exerts a very strong gravitational pull on the planets in our solar system. With the Sun at the center of our solar system, a balance of gravitational forces keeps the planets orbiting the Sun. The time it takes the planets to journey around the Sun (orbit) varies widely. Generally, the planets closer to the Sun such as Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars complete one <span class='key'>revolution</span> around the Sun much more quickly than those planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune that are much further away. Click on the table below to see if you can see this pattern."
msgstr "太陽在我們的太陽系之中發揮強大的引力。太陽作為我們星系的中心，引力的平衡讓其他行星保持繞著太陽運行。每個星球繞著太陽的時間（軌道）差異是非常大的。一般來說，行星越接近太陽，如水星、金星、地球和火星，比遠一些的木星、土星、天王星和海王星，能更快地繞太陽公轉一周。點擊下面的表格，看看你是否能看到此種模式。"

Manned space crafts and unmanned probes have been used to gather information about the surface of the moon while space probes and robots have recorded details about the surface structure and composition of Mars. Here on Earth, advances in spectroscopy (the study of the absorption and radiation of light by matter) and computers have provided much information about the chemical composition of the solar system and the universe."

msgid "Astronomers use an instrument called a \"<span class='key'>spectrometer</span>.\" This instrument analyzes emission of light rays by spreading them out through a prism. The composition of the objects being viewed can then be determined by the patterns created by the spectrometer. Figure 1 below shows the spectrum emitted by white light.

NASA just informed you that a rescue ship cannot pick you up until Mars comes back around to the exact same orbital position it was in when the ship crashed. In other words, you will be stranded on the planet for exactly 1 Mars year. According to the table below, how many Earth days must your friends wait before they see you rescued?"
msgstr "你迫降後受困於火星上。雖然火箭墜毀無法回到太空，它提供足夠的食物、水、住所和氧氣，直到救援團隊抵達。無線電也同樣運作。美國國家航空暨太空總署只告訴你，直到火星繞回當初墜毀時完全相同的軌道上才能有辦法接你。換句話說，你會受困在這個星球上整整1年的時間。根據下表，你的朋友在地球上必須等多久才能見到你獲救？"

msgstr "這就對了！被救出前，需要等地球過了730天的時間。"

msgid "The Sun is a massive ball of super hot gas (mostly hydrogen) that produces tremendous amounts of heat and light through nuclear reactions. Heat and light from the Sun radiates out in all directions through space. About 30% of the Sun’s energy reaching the Earth is reflected back out into our solar system. The rest (about 70%) is absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere, oceans and solid surfaces. When the Sun’s energy hits the Earth, it warms the atmosphere, land and oceans. The radiant energy (heat energy) absorbed by land and water can be stored and released back into the atmosphere. In this way, winds and ocean currents are created. The light reaching plant life on earth is used, through a process called photosynthesis, to help them create food for growth and development. Hence, even in complex food webs, the original source of energy for most living things on Earth can be traced back to sunlight. "
msgstr "太陽是一個巨大的超熱氣體（主要是氫氣），通過核反應產生出大量的熱和光。太陽的光和熱輻射至太空中任何方向。太陽到達地球的能量中，約有30％反射回到我們的太陽系裡。其餘的（約70％）是被地球的大氣、海洋和固體表面吸收。當太陽的能量到達地球，使大氣、陸地和海洋升溫。土地和水吸收的輻射能量（熱能）可以被儲存和釋放至大氣中。如此一來，生成風和洋流。光到達地球被植物使用，這個過程稱為光合作用，幫助植物製造食物和成長與發育。因此，甚至在複雜的食物網中，地球上大部分生物能量的原始來源可以追溯自陽光。"

The ends of the axis around which the Earth spins are called the North and South Poles. Unlike a twirling ballerina spinning straight up and down on her toes, the Earth spins on an axis (<span class='key'>rotation</span>) that is tilted about 23 degrees off the perpendicular to the orbital plane of the Earth. If an imaginary line could be drawn to extend the North Pole far out into space, it would lead very close to a star named Polaris (the North Star). As the Earth spins on its axis, the axis constantly points to the North Star (therefore the North Star, or Polaris, remains at the center of the nighttime sky). All the other stars appear to move in a great circles or arcs. No matter where the Earth is located along its orbit around the Sun, the North Pole points constantly at Polaris (which is approximately 430 million light years away from Earth.)"

msgid "The constant tilt of the Earth throughout the journey around the Sun results in the phenomena on Earth known as the change in seasons.

msgid "Just as Earth orbits around the Sun, the Moon Orbits around Earth. While it takes 365 days for the Earth to orbit the Sun, it takes 27.5 days for the moon to orbit the Earth. And, just like Earth, one side (one half) of the Moon's surface is constantly lighted by the Sun's light. But over the course of roughly one month, the angle between the Sun, Earth and Moon changes. Consequently, the amount of the lighted side of the moon we can see changes. This varying amount explains why we see the phenomena known as the Phases of the Moon. When we can see the entire side of the moon that is being lit, we call that phase a Full Moon. When we see only a partial side of the lighted side of the moon, we call that phase crescent moon. When the moon is on the same side of earth as the Sun, we call that phase the new moon. Some people think that there is a straight line between the Earth, Moon and Sun. But this is not correct. Because of the differences in the planes of orbit (Moon around Earth and Earth around the Sun), only occasionally do all three line up. When that happens, we have either a solar eclipse (when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth) or a lunar eclipse (when the Earth's Shadow crosses the moon)."
