msgid "More big ideas about... specialized cells"
msgstr "更多有關「特化細胞」之大概念"

msgid "Movement. It's something all humans do, although maybe not quite with the same grace and power as this gymnast. Movement requires the interactions of many body systems. The skeletal system must provide support for the body. The nervous system must sense the outside world, process the information, and then deliver instructions to the muscular system to execute complex movements. And the circulatory system must ensure the supply of nutrients and oxygen needed by the body to expend such energy."
msgstr "運動。這是所有人都會做的事情，雖然不如體操選手般優雅且有力。運動需要許多身體系統的相互作用。骨骼系統必須支撐身體。神經系統必須感應外部世界、處裡訊息與傳遞指令於肌肉系統以執行複雜的動作。而且循環系統必須確保人體所需的營養和氧氣的供給。"

msgid "The muscular system is most directly responsible for movement. Its highly specialized cells move bones, propel food through the digestive system, and provide power to the circulatory system. The cells of the muscular system are of three major types: skeletal, smooth and cardiac."
msgstr "肌肉系統是最直接負責我們身體的運動。其高度特化的細胞移動骨頭，通過消化系統推動食物，並且提供循環系統力量。肌肉系統的細胞主要的三種類型：骨骼肌、平滑肌和心肌。"

msgid "Cardiac muscle"
msgstr "心肌"

msgid "Smooth muscle"
msgstr "平滑肌"

msgid "Skeletal muscle"
msgstr "骨骼肌"

msgid "All muscle cells contain protein fibers capable of contracting and relaxing when properly stimulated. The stimulation comes in the form of an impulse that is both chemical and electrical in nature. When stimulated, muscle fibers contract, shortening the length of each muscle cell. Since muscle cells are connected to one another, or through tendons, to bone, some type of movement occurs."
msgstr "所有肌肉細胞含有蛋白質纖維，接受適當刺激時有收縮與舒張的能力。接受的刺激是以脈衝的形式呈現，即化學與電信號的性質。受刺激時，肌肉纖維收縮，縮短每個肌細胞的長度。因為肌肉細胞彼此相連接至骨頭或通過肌腱至骨頭發生運動。"

msgid "Skeletal muscles are attached to bones, some moving and some nonmoving. When the cells of a muscle contract, one of the bones moves. Skeletal muscle cells contain very long protein fibers called actin and myosin, which appear as light and dark bands. As a way to strengthen connections between fibers, skeletal muscles often merge, resulting in tubular cells with multiple nuclei and many energy-releasing <span class='key'>mitochondria</span>. Skeletal muscle is controlled consciously by the nervous system."
msgstr "骨骼肌附著於骨骼，有些移動，有些不移動。當肌肉收縮，其中一個骨頭移動。骨骼肌細胞中含有很長的蛋白質纖維稱為肌動蛋白與肌凝蛋白，其出現為亮帶與暗帶。以此來加強纖維之間的連接，骨骼肌經常合併，導致管狀細胞有多個核和許多釋放能量的線粒體。骨骼肌是由神經系統有意識地控制。"

msgid "Food is moved through the digestive system, and pressure is maintained in the circulatory system using smooth muscles. They lack the dark and light bands of skeletal muscle. Sometimes whole sheets of muscle lose their cell membranes and become a single unit having many nuclei. This type of muscle operates to coordinate complex processes like digestion. Smooth muscle is controlled by the autonomic nervous system outside voluntary control."
msgstr "食物是通過消化系統移動，且靠平滑肌使循環系統中的壓力維持。它們缺乏骨骼肌的暗帶與亮帶。有時候整片肌肉失去其細胞膜和變成具有多核的單元。此種類型的肌肉運行以協調複雜的過程，如消化。平滑肌是隨意控制，由自主神經系統控制。"

msgid "Blood is propelled through the circulatory system when the heart beats or contracts. The heart is made of cardiac muscle and resembles skeletal muscle but its cells generally contain only three nuclei. They are also not attached to bones, but to each other, so that when the muscles contract, so does the heart as a whole. Like smooth muscle, cardiac muscle is controlled by the autonomic nervous system."
msgstr "當心臟跳動或收縮時，血液被推進至循環系統。心臟是由心肌和類似骨骼肌的細包組成，但其細胞通常只含有三個細胞核。它們也不會附著到骨頭，但彼此連接，這樣當肌肉收縮時，心臟即為一個整體。如平滑肌一樣，心肌由自主神經系統的控制。"

msgid "Identifying types of muscles..."

msgid "Smooth muscle is found in organs and blood vessels. It is subconsciously controlled."
msgstr "平滑肌發現於器官和血管中。它是受潛意識控制。"

msgid "Cardiac muscle makes up the heart. It functions independently of our thoughts."
msgstr "心肌組成了心臟。它的功能獨立，不受我們意識控制。"

msgid "Skeletal muscle is under conscious control, and moves bones."
msgstr "骨骼肌是隨意控制移動骨頭。"

msgid "Great job! Smooth and cardiac muscles operate even when we're not thinking about them. Skeletal muscles work when we want them to."
msgstr "太棒了！平滑肌與心肌即使我們沒有想到，它們依然運作。骨骼肌是我們希望它們運作，它們才會運作。"

msgid "Not quite! Smooth muscle is found in organs and blood vessels and is not consciously controlled. Cardiac muscle makes up the heart and functions independently of our thoughts. Thus, only skeletal muscle should be under conscious control as it moves bones."
msgstr "不太對！平滑肌發現於器官和血管中且它是非隨意控制。心肌組成了心臟，它的功能獨立，不受我們意識控制。因此，只有骨骼肌移動骨頭時需意識控制。"

msgid "Using a cellphone..."
msgstr "使用手機……"

msgid "Right now, you're using some sort of electrical device. Maybe it's a computer, maybe a tablet, or even a phone. But you are seeing this image, thinking about what is written, and then responding by touching a screen or moving a mouse."
msgstr "你每天都使用各種電子設備。電腦、平板電腦甚至是手機。但你現在看著這張圖片，想想看上面寫的是什麼，並且透過觸控螢幕或是滑鼠做出回應。"

msgid "The device you are using is an electrical system. It takes your mouse or keyboard direction, transmits it across the Internet, and then displays the response on a screen. This takes electricity, a way of sending a signal long distances at the speed of light."
msgstr "你正在使用的裝置是種電力系統。它需要你的滑鼠或是鍵盤在網路上傳達指令，並且在螢幕上顯示出來。這需要電力，一種以光速傳達長距離訊號的方法。"

msgid "The very same thing is happening in your body as you read this. Information is taken in by your eyes and transmitted to your brain. The brain processes the information, and then sends a response to your fingers. This all happens so quickly because your nervous system is an electrical system as well."
msgstr "當你正在讀這段文字時同樣的事也發生在你身上。訊息透過你的眼睛傳達到你的到大腦。而大腦處裡訊息之後傳達指令給手指。這發生的非常迅速因為你的神經系統也是種電力系統。"

They can form complex networks by connecting to many other cells. The connections are called synapses. Most nerve cells include a cell body, <span class=key>dendrites</span>, and an <span class=key>axon</span>. The cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles. A cell may have many dendrites which serve to bring information to the cell body. Each neuron has a single axon, a very long (sometimes up to 1 meter) structure, which allows the cell to send information to other nerve cells at great distances."
msgstr "神經細胞，稱為神經元，能夠通過一系列電和化學的過程處理和傳送信息。它們通過連接到許多其它細胞形成複雜的網絡。連接是所謂的突觸。大多數神經細胞包括細胞本體、樹突和軸突。細胞本體含有細胞核和其他胞器。一個細胞單元有許多用來將訊息傳遞給細胞本體的樹突。每個神經元都有單一個很長的（有時高達一米）軸突，使得細胞能夠傳遞訊息給很遠的細胞。"

msgid "Sensory neurons are cells that detect and transmit information from the five senses. They are located throughout the body, and include mechanical receptors for pressure, pain and temperature; chemical receptors for taste and smell; auditory receptors for sound; and photoreceptors for vision. Sensory neurons send information to the <span class=key>central nervous system (CNS)</span>."
msgstr "感覺神經元細胞是偵測和傳遞來自五感的訊息。它們分別位於整個身體，包括壓力、疼痛和溫度的機械受體；味覺和嗅覺的化學感受器；聲音的聽覺感受器；視覺的光感受器。感覺神經元發送訊息致中樞神經系統（CNS）。"

msgid "The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. CNS neurons, also known as interneurons, connect to both sensory and motor neurons, as well as to many other CNS neurons. These connections allow sensory input to be evaluated, and an appropriate response sent out to the body."
msgstr "中樞神經系統由大腦和脊髓組成。CNS神經元也被稱為中間神經元，同時連接感覺和運動神經元，以及許多其他CNS神經元。這些連結使感覺訊號輸入進行評估，和做出適當的身體反應。"

msgid "That response depends upon motor neurons. These cells, located in the spinal cord receive information from CNS cells and transmit electrical signals, through their axons, to muscles. These signals stimulate movement."
msgstr "該反應取決於運動神經元。這些細胞位於脊髓，透過軸突接收來自中樞神經系統細胞的訊息和傳輸電訊號於肌肉。這些信號刺激運動。"

msgid "What is a major difference between axons and dendrites?"
msgstr "軸突與樹突之間最主要的差異是什麼？"

msgid "Axons bring information to the cell body; dendrites send information away."
msgstr "軸突將信息傳送給細胞本體；樹突則是發送訊息出去。"

msgid "Axons take information away from the cell body; dendrites bring information in."
msgstr "軸突提取訊息離開細胞本體；樹突則是將訊息帶進細胞本體。"

msgid "Red blood cells are some of the simplest, yet most highly specialized cells in the human body. They are responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the tissues where it is needed to keep other cells alive.  Once the oxygen is delivered, <span class='key'>red blood cells</span> are responsible for moving cells' carbon dioxide waste to the lungs, where it can be expelled from the body.  Once complete, the cycle repeats."
msgstr "紅血球在人體中是最簡單也是高度特化的細胞。他們負責從肺輸送氧氣到需要的器官，維持細胞的生命。一旦將氧氣送達，紅血球就必須負責將二氧化碳運輸到肺部將他排出身體。完成之後則繼續這個循環。"

msgid "Red blood cells are formed from stem cells in bone marrow. As they mature, their internal structures disintegrate, leaving them as disk-shaped bags of hemoglobin surrounded by cell membrane. Hemoglobin is the red protein that is able to carry oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide to the lungs. Red cells' small size and smooth shape allow them to travel into the smallest spaces in the body."
msgstr "紅血球細胞是由骨髓裡的幹細胞而來。隨著逐漸成熟，它們的內部結構瓦解，使它們形成裡面有血紅素的圓盤袋狀的樣子，外面有細胞膜包圍。血紅素是可以將氧氣運輸到其他組織並且帶回二氧化碳到肺部的紅蛋白。紅血球的體積很小，而且是流線的造型，可以讓它們在身體裡最小的空間中穿梭。"

None of us is an exact copy of either one of them, but we share many of their characteristics. Offspring are the products of both of their parents. When a pair of cells merges, one from the mother and one from the father, an embryo is formed. Under the right circumstances, that <span class=key>embryo</span> develops into a fetus and, much later, a baby is born."
msgstr "所有的人都有許多共同點。有一件我們共同擁有的事，就是我們看起來都很像我們的父親與母親。我們當中沒有任何一個人是父母精確的副本，但是我們共享了許多他們的特點。子代皆為父母的產物。當一對細胞融合，一個來自母親，一個來自父親，一個胚胎便就此形成了。在正常情況下，胚胎發育成胎兒，接著一個嬰兒出生。"

The head carries a half set of the father's chromosomes. The mid piece contains mitochondria capable of releasing large amounts of energy. The tail uses that energy to propel the sperm forward until it encounters an egg cell."
msgstr "攜帶此信息的細胞被稱為生殖細胞或配子。雌配子為卵。雄配子稱為精子。圖示中的細胞為精子細胞。精子在睪丸中製成，包括一個頭部、中節及尾部。頭部帶有半套來自父親的染色體。中節含有能夠釋放出大量能量的線粒體。尾部使用能量來推動精子前向運動，直到遇到一個卵細胞。"

Egg cells are produced in <span class='key'>ovaries</span>, and contain a half set of the mother's chromosomes as well as a large store of food for the development of an embryo after <span class='key'>fertilization</span>. While males are able to produce millions of sperm cells each day, females usually produce only a single egg cell each month during their reproductive years."
msgstr "如圖像顯示，卵細胞比精子細胞大得多。卵細胞在卵巢產生，包含半套母親的染色體以及受精後提供胚胎發育的食物儲存場。男生每天可以產生數以百萬計的精子細胞，女性在生育年齡期間通常每個月只產生一個卵細胞。"
