"You're right. The key to the puzzle is in the name of the poem... The Rime "

"'Mariner' is a word related to the word 'marine' – like if you wanted to be "
"a marine scientist you'd be studying the ocean. So if you were a sailor on a "
"ship on the ocean and ran out of water on the ship, you would be surrounded "
"by water but there would be none to drink!! And that's because the ocean is "
"composed of <span class='key'>salt water</span> and we only drink <span "
"class='key'>fresh water</span> – water with no salt in it!! As a matter of "
"fact, drinking salt water can be harmful if you drink too much and don't "
"drink any fresh water. If you ever swam in salt water and swallowed a "
"mouthful, you would know how bad it tastes. But don't worry – a mouthful "
