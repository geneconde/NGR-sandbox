msgid "Thinking about... energy and chemical changes"
msgstr ""

msgid "Have you ever heard people say: \"Wow, she really has a lot of energy. I wonder where she gets it from?\" Usually people are talking about their friends or relatives that are always \"on-the-go.\" They go to work or go to school, they do athletics or work out, join clubs, they do volunteer work and they never seem to get tired. Where DO they get all that energy? Think about all the things YOU do everyday. Where does your energy come from?"
msgstr ""

msgid "And then think about all of the other things that you see happening and changing all around you – like cars moving, the lights going on in your house, flowers blooming in the garden, rain falling from the sky. What makes all of those things happen?"

msgid "All of the energy that is stored in the chemical compounds that make up the food we eat ultimately comes from the Sun. Plants have the ability to take the sun's energy and store as chemicals that are food for the plant – and for us. Cows and people eat the plants to get our energy to live – and sometimes we eat the cows or drink their milk. We all need water to help the biological processes of living take place, but water doesn't actually provide us with energy. And power plants provide the energy to package and refrigerate the food.  But the ultimate source of the energy that's in the food we eat originally comes from the Sun."

msgid "Reviewing big ideas about... energy and chemical changes"
msgstr ""

msgid "Look all around you. Energy is everywhere. You might not be able to see it directly because it's not a thing. But you can see what it does. Wherever you look, something is happening: your friends are moving around, playing ball, riding a bike, or just talking; cars are driving by; a pencil just rolled across your desk and fell on the floor. Even in things you can't see, something is happening: the air in your room is moving to make sounds; the invisible molecules of oxygen and nitrogen that make air are even bouncing around to create the temperature you feel in the air; and you – you are breathing and your heart is beating and even if you can't see it, the cells that make up your body are growing and making more cells to make you bigger and stronger every day. And all of this activity – everything that's happening – all the activity in the universe happens because of energy."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scientists define <span class='key'>energy</span> as \"the ability to do <span class='key'>work</span>\". That's one of the most important ideas in all of science! And when they say \"work\", they don't just mean it like doing your school-\"work\" or your home-\"work\", or when someone goes to \"work\" to make money and earn a living. What scientists mean by \"work\" is anything that causes matter to change or move. So everything that happens to matter in the universe, any movement or change to matter, is considered work and requires energy."

msgid "More big ideas about... energy and chemical changes"
msgstr ""

msgid "Energy is everywhere and it's necessary when any kind of changes occur in the universe. What kind of changes? Here are some examples. When an object speeds up, slows down, starts or stops, these are changes in motion that require energy. When something heats up or cools down, energy is involved. When it's dark and you turn on the light, it requires energy. When you're sitting and you get up and walk, energy is needed. Anything that happens requires energy!!"
msgstr ""

msgid "And here's another very important idea from science about energy: \"Energy cannot be created or destroyed - it just changes forms\". This is called the \"<span class = 'key upper'>Law of Conservation of Energy</span>\". It just means that whenever any of those changes we were talking about happens, energy is never gained or lost in the universe - it just changes forms. That's why energy is never actually \"produced\" by a batter, or a windmill, or any other device. These devices just take one form of energy that already exists and changes it into a different form."
msgstr ""

msgid "So what are these different forms or kinds of energy? Here the names scientists use for just a few kinds of energy you might encounter everyday."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hover on the different kinds of energy to see the details."

The example shown in the diagram below shows how that happens when energy from the sun gets converted to energy that your body uses in your everyday life for you to be alive."
msgstr ""

msgid "1. <span class='key'>Solar energy</span> from the sun - light and heat - is converted, or changed, into energy for plants to live and grow. And the plant can store some of that energy as <span class='key'>chemical potential energy</span> in the food the plant makes. This happens in the plant's green leaves by a series of <span class='key'>chemical reactions</span> called <span class='key'>photosynthesis</span>."
msgstr ""

msgid "Summarizing big ideas about... energy and chemical changes"
msgstr ""

msgid "Energy is everywhere around you. Energy makes things happen! Anything that moves or changes requires energy. But it's not as simple as just one kind of energy. There are many forms of energy and they keep changing forms as they cause things to happen. For instance, <span class='key'>light energy</span> from the sun is one form of energy."
msgstr ""

msgid "It travels through space until it hits the earth and then some of it is <span class='key'>converted</span> into <span class='key'>heat energy</span> that changes the temperature of the earth making it warmer. Also, some of the light from the sun is absorbed by the leaves of green plant, and by special chemical reactions called <span class='key'>photosynthesis</span>, the <span class='key'>light energy</span> is converted into <span class='key'>chemical energy</span> stored in the plant as food."
msgstr ""

msgid "We eat some of the foods plants produce and it becomes our source of energy. When energy is stored, like food in plants, we call it <span class='key'>potential energy</span> because it isn't doing anything right now but it has the \"potential\" to make something happen when it's released. When something is in motion, like a ball rolling down a hill it contains energy of motion that scientists call <span class='key'>kinetic energy</span>."
msgstr ""

msgid "Energy can take many forms such as; sound energy, electrical energy, light energy, heat energy, chemical energy, kinetic energy, potential energy, nuclear energy and biological energy. But it's important to know that the universe doesn't create any new energy or destroy any existing energy. It just constantly keeps converting one kind of energy to another to keep the universe working. The universe is a very good at recycling energy. Scientists call that the <span class='key'>Law of Conservation of Energy</span>."
