Where DO they get all that energy? Think about all the things YOU do everyday. Where does your energy come from?"

Cows and people eat the plants to get our energy to live – and sometimes we eat the cows or drink their milk. We all need water to help the biological processes of living take place, but water doesn't actually provide us with energy. And power plants provide the energy to package and refrigerate the food.  But the ultimate source of the "

"Look all around you. Energy is everywhere. You might not be able to see it directly because it's not a thing. But you can see what it does. Wherever you look, something is happening: your friends are moving around, playing ball, riding a bike, or just talking; cars are driving by; a pencil just rolled across your desk and fell on the floor. Even in things you can't see, something is happening: the air in your room is moving to make sounds; the invisible molecules of oxygen and nitrogen that make air are even bouncing around to create the temperature you feel in the air; "
"and you – you are breathing and your heart is beating and even if you can't see it, the cells that make up your body are growing and making more cells to make you bigger and stronger every day. And all of this activity – everything that's happening – all the activity in the universe happens because of energy."
msgstr "看看四周，能量存在於各個地方。你或許不能直接地看到因為它不是個「物體」，但你可以看到它是什麼。無論在哪裡你觀察，所有發生的事情：例如你的朋友在附近走動、玩球、騎腳踏車或者講話聊天；車輛行駛經過你身邊；或只是一枝筆在桌上滾動掉落地面。就是算是你沒看到的事物，還是一直存在著：在房間流動的空氣發出聲音、看不見的氧氣及氮氣交互反應創造你所感受到的溫度、而就算有時你無法看到，你一直都有呼吸及心跳，細胞讓你的身體持續成長並且創造細胞讓你每天都更加強壯。所有這些活動－所有在宇宙間發生的事物，都是因為有能量的存在。"

msgid "Scientists define <span class='key'>energy</span> as \"the ability to do <span class='key'>work</span>\". That's one of the most important ideas in all of science! And when they say \"work\", they don't just mean it like doing your school-\"work\" or your home-\"work\", or when someone goes to \"work\" to make money and earn a living. What scientists mean by \"work\" is anything that causes matter to change or move. So everything that happens to matter in the universe, any movement or change to matter, is considered work and requires energy."
msgstr "科學家定義能量為：有做功的能力。這在所有的科學中是很重要的概念。而當他們說到「做功」，他們不只是指學校中的「工作」或者你的回家作業，也不是只上班的「工作」，更不是賺錢養家的「工作」。科學家口中所說的「做功」，是指所有會導致改變或移動的事物。所以所有在宇宙間發生的事，所有動作或是改變發生，都是「做功」並且需要能源。"

msgid "More big ideas about... energy and chemical changes"
msgstr "更多有關「能量與化學變化」的大概念"

msgid "Energy is everywhere and it's necessary when any kind of changes occur in the universe. What kind of changes? Here are some examples. When an object speeds up, slows down, starts or stops, these are changes in motion that require energy. When something heats up or cools down, energy is involved. When it's dark and you turn on the light, it requires energy. When you're sitting and you get up and walk, energy is needed. Anything that happens requires energy!!"
msgstr "能源是無處不在且是必要的，當任何一種變化發生在宇宙中。是什麼樣的變化？這裡有一些例子。當一個物體的加快、減慢、開始或停止，這些是需要能量的運動的變化。當某種東西被加熱或冷卻，都需要能量參與。當黑暗的時候，你把燈打開，這需要的能量。當你坐著和你站起來走路，這也都需要能量。發生的任何事情需要能量！"

msgid "And here's another very important idea from science about energy: \"Energy cannot be created or destroyed - it just changes forms\". This is called the \"<span class = 'key upper'>Law of Conservation of Energy</span>\". It just means that whenever any of those changes we were talking about happens, energy is never gained or lost in the universe - it just changes forms. That's why energy is never actually \"produced\" by a battery, or a windmill, or any other device. These devices just take one form of energy that already exists and changes it into a different form."
msgstr "另一個非常重要的來自科學有關能量的概念“能量不能被創造或毀滅 - 它只是改變形式”。這就是所謂的“能量守恆定律”。它只是意味著，每當我們談論任何發生的變化，能量永遠不會在宇宙中獲得或消失，只是改變了它的形式。這就是為什麼能量從未真正由電池、風車或任何其他設備所“產生”。這些設備只是把已經存在的一種能量形式改變成另一種不同的形式。"

msgid "So what are these different forms or kinds of energy? Here the names scientists use for just a few kinds of energy you might encounter everyday."

There are many forms of energy and they keep changing forms as they cause things to happen. For instance, <span class='key'>light energy</span> from the sun is one form of energy."
msgstr "能量在身邊隨處可見，它是讓所有事情發生的最源頭！所有事情無論移動或是改變都需要能量。但它需要的卻不只一種能源。世界上有各種各樣的能量形式而它們在讓事情發生時不斷的改變。例如光能是太陽散發出的能量之一。"

msgid "It travels through space until it hits the earth and then some of it is <span class='key'>converted</span> into <span class='key'>heat energy</span> that changes the temperature of the earth making it warmer. Also, some of the light from the sun is absorbed by the leaves of green plant, and by special chemical reactions called <span class='key'>photosynthesis</span>, the <span class='key'>light energy</span> is converted into <span class='key'>chemical energy</span> stored in the plant as food."

msgid "We eat some of the foods plants produce and it becomes our source of energy. When energy is stored, like food in plants, we call it <span class='key'>potential energy</span> because it isn't doing anything right now but it has the \"potential\" to make something happen when it's released. When something is in motion, like a ball rolling down a hill it contains energy of motion that scientists call <span class='key'>kinetic energy</span>."
msgstr "我們會食用一些由植物所產生的食物，而它將成為我們的能量來源。當能量，例如植物的食物，被儲存時，我們將它稱為「位能」，因為它的「潛在因子」所以它不會馬上產生作用，當它釋放出來才會產生作用。當事物開始產生動態的變化，就像球從山上滾下來時，包含著運動的能量，科學家們將它稱作「動能」。"

msgid "Energy can take many forms such as; sound energy, electrical energy, light energy, heat energy, chemical energy, kinetic energy, potential energy, nuclear energy and biological energy. But it's important to know that the universe doesn't create any new energy or destroy any existing energy. It just constantly keeps converting one kind of energy to another to keep the universe working. The universe is a very good at recycling energy. Scientists call that the <span class='key'>Law of Conservation of Energy</span>."
msgstr "能源可採多種形式存在，例如：聲能、電能、光能、熱能、化學能、動能、位能、核能以及生物能。但最重要的是去了解在宇宙不會去重造任何新的能量或是破壞任何現有的能量。它只是持續不斷的轉換各種能量以保持宇宙中的運作。宇宙非常善於回收能量。科學家們將這稱作「能量守恆定律」。"
