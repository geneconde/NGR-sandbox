msgid "Insulators are used to prevent heat energy from moving from place to place. The special mitten that you use to take something from the oven acts as an insulator. The mitten prevents the heat energy from moving from the pan or dish that is at a high temperature to your hand that is at a lower temperature. The special jackets, pants and gloves that you wear in the winter are made of insulating materials to keep heat energy from going from your warm body to the cold outside air."

msgstr "<span class='key'>熱</span>是能量的一種形式，它能使物質的微小粒子(如分子或原子)產生較快的<span class='key'>振動或移動</span>。當熱能流進物體時，這些粒子會振動或移動得更激烈；相反的，如果物體的熱能流出時，粒子的振動或移動，就會變得比較慢。"

msgid "How fast or slowly the tiny particles of matter vibrate or move around is called <span class='key'>temperature</span>. The faster the particles move, the higher the temperature is. The more slowly the particles move, the lower the temperature is. How much heat energy is needed to raise or lower the temperature of matter depends on the amount of matter involved. The more matter there is, the more heat energy has to be exchanged to raise or lower the temperature."
msgstr "物質中的那些微小粒子(例如：分子或原子)，它們振動與移動的快慢，表現出來就是 <span class='key'>溫度</span>。越快，溫度越高；越慢，溫度越低。使物質提高或降低溫度所需的熱能，也和物質的質量有關；物體的量越多，就需要越多的熱能流進或流出，以改變物體的溫度。"

msgid "More big ideas... about heating and cooling"
msgstr "關鍵概念加強…加熱和冷卻"

msgid "Other forms of energy can be changed into heat energy.  Wood and natural gas can be burned to produce heat for your home. Electricity can be used to create heat in your toaster, oven or microwave to cook your food. Pressing your hands together and rubbing back and forth quickly produces heat energy. This heat is produced by <span class='key'>friction</span>, the force between two things or surfaces that rub together. Since there is always friction when two things rub together, there is always heat energy generated."
msgstr "各種型態的能量都可以轉變成熱能。例如，木材和天然氣燃燒會產生的熱能，使家裡變溫暖。電力也能轉變成熱能，讓烤麵包機，烤箱等變熱來烹煮食物。還有，當我們雙手合攏來回迅速摩擦，也會產生熱能，這種熱是由<span class='key'>摩擦</span>產生。"

msgid "When we add heat to a substance, the substance changes in some way. For example,  by adding heat to an ice cube it causes it to change from a solid to a liquid. In this case only the form has changed. This is called a <span class='key'>physical change</span>. But sometimes heat can change a substance into a new substance. This is called a <span class='key'>chemical change</span>. The new substance  has a different chemical composition with different properties. When we turn batter into a pancake, we are using  heat to cook and chemically change the batter ingredients into something different -- a pancake."
msgstr "當我們把熱加到某一個物質上時，這物質會有一些改變。例如，當對冰塊加熱，冰從固體變成液體。這屬於形態的改變，也就是一種的<span class='key'>物理變化</span> 。但有時候，加熱可以使一個物質轉變成為另一個新物質。這就是所謂的<span class='key'>化學變化</span> ，這變化產生的新物質具有不同的化學組成和性質。例如，當我們把生麵糰煎成煎餅，就是對生麵糰加熱，使它產生化學變化而變成煎餅，煎餅就是一種不同於生麵糰的新物質。"

msgid "In a physical change, we can often reverse the change. In the example of heating an ice cube, we can reverse it and freeze the water again. But in a chemical change, we often cannot reverse the change. In the example of making pancakes, we can't change the pancakes back into batter again."
msgstr "物質進行了物理變化後，我們可以再使它轉變回來。例如，冰塊加熱成水後，可以再結成冰。但如果物質進行的是化學變化中，我們常常就無法轉變回去了。例如，生麵糰煮成了煎餅，我們就無法再把煎餅變回生麵糰了。"

msgid "When something vibrates, it moves back and forth or up and down. Vibrations are made when something that is in a resting position is disturbed in some way. Vibrations can cause the movement of other objects nearby and can create sound."
msgstr "一個物體不斷的上下或左右的來回運動，就就作「振動」。當靜止的物體被擾動時，振動就可能發生。同樣的，一個振動的物體也會造成鄰近物體的振動或移動。振動也能發出聲音。"

msgid "Different types of vibrations happen around us all the time. People, animals, cars, and machines make sounds when they cause particles in the air to vibrate. Dropping a pebble in the water makes the surface of the water vibrate. Earthquakes cause buildings to vibrate as well."
msgstr "不同類型的振動，隨時在我們周圍發生。人、動物、汽車、機器發出聲音時，聲音會使空氣粒子振動。石頭掉入水中，水面也會振動。還有，地震也會造成建築物振動。"

msgid "Temperature"
msgstr "溫度"

msgid "How fast or slowly the tiny particles of matter vibrate or move around is called temperature. The faster the particles move, the higher the temperature is. The more slowly the particles move, the lower the temperature is."
msgstr "物質中的微小粒子(例如：分子或原子)的振動與移動的快慢，表現出來就是「溫度」。當粒子振動或移動的越快，溫度相對越高；粒子移動或振動越慢，溫度相對越低。"

msgid "How much heat energy is needed to raise or lower the temperature of matter depends on the amount of matter involved. The more matter there is, the more heat energy has to be exchanged to raise or lower the temperature."
msgstr "提高或降低物體溫度所需的熱能，和物體的質量有關。物體的量越多，就需要越多的熱能流進或流出，才能改變物體的溫度。"

msgid "Friction"
msgstr "摩擦"

msgid "Friction is the force between two things or surfaces that rub together. Since there is always friction when two things rub together, there is always heat energy generated."
msgstr "摩擦是兩個物體表面接觸並作不同方向的運動時，所產生的阻力。因為兩個表面接觸相互運動時，都會有摩擦力，所以會有熱能產生。"

msgid "Physical change"
msgstr "物理變化"

msgid "When a substance goes through a physical change, only its form or appearance changes. Even though it may look different, it is still the same substance. For example, when water freezes, it turns to ice. The ice and the water are the same substance. Only their forms are different."
msgstr "當物質發生「物理變化」，它只是在形態和外觀有了不同，物理變化前後，它都是同一種物質。例如，當水結冰時，變為冰。冰和水的型態和外觀不同，但它們都是一樣的物質。"

msgid "Another example is sawdust. If someone takes a saw and saws into wood, some of the wood breaks into tiny pieces and becomes sawdust. The sawdust is still wood. It is just wood in a different form. It has gone through a physical change."
msgstr "另一個例子是木屑。當用斧頭劈開木頭時，會有一些木屑掉下來。這些木屑仍是木材，只不過形狀有些不同而已。這過程屬於「物理變化」。"

msgid "Chemical change"
msgstr "化學變化"

msgid "A chemical change is a change in the chemical composition of a substance to produce a new material with different properties. When we turn batter into a pancake, we are using heat to cook and chemically change the raw ingredients into something different."
msgstr "「化學變化」指的是一種物質變成了另外一種具有不同組成和不同性質的物質。舉例來說，生麵糰變成了煎餅，就是化學變化，我們用熱來烹煮生麵糰，這就是讓生的食材進行化學變化，形成不同的物質。"

msgid "Conduction is the process by which heat energy flows from an object at a higher temperature that comes in contact with an object at a lower temperature. If you have ever picked up a spoon from a hot cup of chocolate, the spoon became hotter by conduction."
msgstr "「傳導」，指的是熱能從溫度高的物體傳到溫度較低物體的過程。當你從熱湯中拿起湯匙，湯匙也會是熱的，因為熱湯已將熱能傳導給原本較低溫的湯匙，使湯匙變熱了。"

msgid "Heat can move from one place to another by convection. Convection is when heat energy moves when matter containing the heat moves like warm air rising. It is usually warmer near the ceiling of a room than on the floor because the warmer air rises to the ceiling by convection and cold air sinks to the bottom of the room. Warm water also rises and cold water sinks by convection."
msgstr "「對流」，指得是像空氣這一類的物質，會因為流動，而使得熱能可以傳遞到不同地方的現象。也就是因為有了對流現象，所以，地面的熱空氣可以藉由對流將熱能傳到其他溫度比較低的區域。較熱的水也是會上升而造成對流，傳遞熱能的。"

msgid "Radiation is any energy that is given off by a source and moves as waves, particles, or rays. There are many different types of radiation. Light and heat are both forms of radiation."
msgstr "「輻射」，就是從某一個物體放射出波動，微小粒子、或者射線的一種現象。很多物體都會有輻射的現象，例如：太陽、燃燒中的火爐等等。輻射的形式有很多種，其中，「光」是一種輻射、「熱」也是一種輻射形式。"

msgid "Some types of radiation can be very harmful to people, but other types of radiation can be helpful. A special type of radiation, called gamma radiation, can be used to help people fight diseases such as cancer. Gamma radiation kills cells, but when pointed directly at cancer cells, it can help a person fight off cancer by killing these diseased cells."
msgstr "有些輻射對於人類是有害的；但有些是有幫助的。例如，有一種輻射，稱作伽瑪射線(Gamma)，我們用來直接照射並殺死癌細胞，伽瑪射線能有效的幫助人類對抗癌症。"

msgid "Conductor"
msgstr "熱的導體"

msgid "A conductor is something that lets heat go through it. Conductors are used to transfer energy from place to place."
msgstr "「導體」，可以讓熱能通過。透過它，能量可以從一個地方傳遞到另一個地方。"

msgid "An insulator is something that does not let heat go through it easily."
msgstr "熱的「絕緣體」，指的就是熱能無法輕易通過的物質。"

msgid "Insulators are used to prevent heat energy from moving from place to place. The special mitten that you use to take something from the oven acts as an insulator."
msgstr "熱的絕緣體，可以用來防止熱能從一個區域移動到另一個區域。它也有它的用處，我們從烤箱中拿出熱的物體，常會戴上專用的隔熱手套，它就是一種熱絕緣體。"
