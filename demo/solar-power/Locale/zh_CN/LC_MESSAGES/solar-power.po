"Water is found on Earth's surface as a liquid in lakes, rivers, streams and "
"oceans and as a solid in glaciers, snow cover and ice. The radiant energy of "
"the sun heats water and causes it to <span id='ans1'></span> (to change from "

"small droplets collect into bigger droplet and fall back to earth's surface "
"or <span id='ans3'></span> as liquid rain or solid snow, hail, or sleet."
