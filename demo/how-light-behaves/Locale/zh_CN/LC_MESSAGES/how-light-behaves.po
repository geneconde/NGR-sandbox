"光。藍車是藍色的是因為藍光被車子反射同時其他的色光被吸收。如果光線可以從一種物質通過到另一種物質，它可以被折射。當光被折射，它會改變它的方向。這會發生在光線以一個角度從空氣進到水中的時候。鏡片用來折射以幫助人看得更清楚。太陽能板可以用來將光能改變成熱能與電能。"

msgid "Correct. The light bent upon moving from the surrounding air into the glass, and it changed direction again when moving from the glass back into the surrounding air."
msgstr "對。光線從空氣中進到玻璃會向上彎折移動，而且當從玻璃移動回空氣中時它會再次改變方向。"

msgid "No. If the light had been absorbed by the prism, it would have remained within the prism rather than passing through the prism and exiting through the opposite side."

msgstr "不完全。如果窗戶是乾的，它比較像是透明的，可以讓所有的光線穿過它。"

msgid "Way to go! The water on the window is causing slight changes to the path light takes through it, making the objects on the other side of the glass look fuzzy."
msgstr "這是個方法！窗戶上的水會讓要穿過的光線行進路線有些改變，會讓在玻璃另一端的物體看起來模糊。"

msgstr "不完全。如果光從水面反射，它會反彈並停留在水面下。這樣漁夫就完全不會看到魚。"

msgid "Yep! The light changes direction as it moves from the water into the air. This bending of light is known as refraction, and it makes the fish appear to be closer to the surface than it actually is."
msgstr "是的！光會改變方向就像是它從水中移動到空氣中。這樣光的彎曲被認為是一種折射，而且它也會讓魚出現在比實際上更接近水面的位置。"
