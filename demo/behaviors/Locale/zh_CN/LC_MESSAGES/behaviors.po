"<span class='key'>Behavior</span> is the way that a living thing acts and "

"<span class='key'>stimulus</span> and how a living thing reacts, a <span "
"class='key'>response</span>. When scientists study behavior, they are "
"looking at the response of an organism to different stimuli. Here's a simple "
"illustration. Think about what you would do if you attempted to warm your "
"hands over a campfire, but got too close to the flames. If the heat of the "
"flame caused you pain, your immediate response would most likely be to pull "
"your hand back very quickly. This response is your behavior."

"離火太近時，你會怎麼做？如果火的高溫讓你覺得疼痛，你最有可能的反應就是把手縮"

"Instincts are more complex behavior patterns than reflexes. For example, "
"once sea turtles hatch from their nests in the sand, they instinctively move "
"towards the water where they are safer. This instinct is triggered by the "
"turtles' response to brightness. Because the open ocean is naturally "
"brighter than the land, the sea turtles head toward the water. Like "

"Unlike innate behavior, <span class='key'>learned behaviors</span> are "
