In most metals, these negatively charged electrons begin to move away from the nucleus if a <span class='key'>magnet</span> moves near the metal or if the metal moves near a magnet. The electrons in the atoms of a wire can be made to move one direction or the other, depending on how the wire and magnet are moved.

The light given off by cities at night is visible from space.  That makes it easy to identify the parts of the Earth with large populations, but it also points out the importance of producing light energy as efficiently as possible.  Traditional incandescent light bulbs convert electricity into light energy by heating up a thin wire or filament made of Tungsten.  These bulbs were first designed by Thomas Edison in the late 1800’s.  In order to emit light, the filament in an incandescent bulb must reach a temperature over 4000º Fahrenheit.  In fact, these bulbs emit more thermal energy (95%) than light energy (5%)."

They still emit more thermal energy (80%) than light energy (20%), but that still makes them four times as efficient as <span class='key'>incandescent bulbs</span>.  Fluorescent lights are more efficient because the light is produced by passing electric current through a gas (mercury vapor) rather than heating a wire."

LEDs emit light by applying a voltage to a small semi-conducting chip.  Over time, scientists have developed different chemical compounds for LEDs that produce different colors of light. Compared to LEDs, fluorescent lamps require four times as much energy to produce the same amount of light, and incandescent bulbs require more than sixteen times as much energy.  At present, the purchase price for LED bulbs is quite a bit more than traditional bulbs, but this can be balanced out by the longer life span for LED bulbs.  Incandescent bulbs only last around 1,000 hours before they need to be replaced, while some LEDs can last up to 50,000 hours.  That’s why you’re starting to see LEDs everywhere from reading lamps to traffic lights!"
