msgid "When people change the environment by building a mall, a school, or a housing development, they affect all of the living things that used to live in the natural environment - plants and animals - in many ways. Some big strong animals, like a deer or coyote, might move to a new home if they can find one nearby. But other animals, like fish or frogs, might just die because they can't move. Sometimes you can see a few birds inside the mall but that's because they get trapped in there and can't find their way out."
msgstr "當人類設立購物中心、學校或是開發住宅區改變環境，在許多層面影響了原本居住在此自然環境的一切 - 無論動物或是植物。有些像是鹿或狼等的大型動物，如果牠們可以在附近找得到的話，可能會遷移建立一個新家。但像是魚或是青蛙等小型動物因為無法移居，可能就此死亡。有時候你會看到有些鳥在商場內，只因牠們找不到出去的路所以被困在裡面。"

msgid "Preparing your first quick check…"
msgstr "準備開始第一個快速檢查..."

msgid "Wrong - Eating breakfast requires farms to make your food – cereal, eggs, and bacon, whatever you eat. And these farms had to change whatever habitat existed before it became a farm, so farms have a great environmental impact to make food for us."
msgstr "錯 - 吃早餐需要農場來製造食物 - 無論你吃的任何東西，包含麥片、雞蛋與培根。農場不得不改變原有的棲息地，為了製造食物給人們，農場對環境有很大的影響。"

msgid "Wrong - Going to school is a big one. It requires transportation such as a car or a bus – which requires fuel like gasoline and oil. And the school was built from lots of materials from the environment – like your house – but even more. Then the environment, where the school is located, had to be destroyed to make room for the school."
msgstr "錯 - 上學就是一個最大的環境影響例子。上學需要交通運輸工具，如汽車或公共汽車，這些都需要燃料，如汽油和油。且建造一間學校，需要來許多取自於環境中的材料 - 就好比你的房子。接著，學校要置於一個環境中，勢必要摧毀這個環境以挪出空間來建造學校。"

msgid "Wrong - Watching TV requires electricity that usually comes from burning fossil fuel or damming rivers. An exception might be if your house uses solar powered electricity. But even then, you're probably watching TV in your house which required wood and other materials to build it that were taken from the environment."
msgstr "錯 - 看電視需要電力，而電力來自於燃燒化石燃料或河流建築的水壩，除非你的房子使用太陽能發電，但即使是如此，你要在你的屋子裡看電視，這屋子建造的材料都取自於環境中！"

msgid "Right!! Actually - all of a student's daily activities have some negative effect on the environment."
msgstr "正確的！事實上 - 所有學生的日常生活皆對環境造成負面的影響。"

msgid "You got it! Shipping ports require a coastline on the seacoast or a large lake. Hydroelectric dam requires a river to dam up to create a reservoir to store water that will fall through the generators in the dam producing electricity. Logging and clear cutting happen in the forest natural environment. Farms are usually the result of plowing and replacing the natural environments of fields and meadows."
msgstr "答對了！航運港口需要海岸線或是較大的湖泊。水力發電大壩需要一條河截流創造一個水庫以蓄水，接著水向下流過大壩中的發電機以產生電力。砍伐發生在森林自然環境中，農場往往是翻耕犁地的結果，把自然環境變成了田野和草原。"

msgid "Not quite! Shipping ports require a coastline on the seacoast or a large lake. Hydroelectric dam requires a river to dam up to create a reservoir to store water that will fall through the generators in the dam producing electricity. Logging and clear cutting happen in the forest natural environment. Farms are usually the result of plowing and replacing the natural environments of fields and meadows."

msgstr "回顧有關...「人類對環境的影響」的核心概念"

msgid "Humans are part of the environment too. We're animals like the deer, the birds, and the fish. But we're different from most animals. Animals in the wild only take what they need from the environment to survive, but humans take more than what they need just to survive. They often take as much as they can get, not only to survive, but also to exploit the environment to be comfortable and make money. Whatever resources we use from the environment to make us more comfortable and make our lives better can also have negative impacts on the environment – which then can have negative impacts on us as well – because we're part of the environment.  "
msgstr "人類也是環境的一部分。我們人類就是動物，如鹿、鳥和魚。但是我們和大多數動物不同。野生的動物只需要從環境中取得生存所需要的，但人類往往取得更多，不僅是為了要生存，同時也利用環境使自己舒適和賺得更多的錢。不論這些資源使我們更加舒適和使我們生活過得更好，這些都對環境造成負面的影響，反過來也會對我們人類造成影響，因為我們也是屬於環境的一部分。"

msgid ""
"Water is just one example of how humans impact the environment. Almost all living things need water to survive. But most animals in the wild just take small sips of water from streams and lakes every day to meet their needs. But what are some things humans do beyond their simple daily requirements of satisfying their thirst? First of all, we put big dams across rivers to generate electricity. We also put dams up to create reservoirs to supply water for big cities and to make lakes for boating, swimming, and fishing. People also use water for more than just drinking. We use it to take showers, wash our clothes, and water our lawns. And, many big farms and ranches that produce all the food we eat use lots and lots of water to irrigate (water) their crops and livestock (animals). All of these human activities greatly impact the environment. The dams turn the rivers into lakes, which affects the survival of plants and animals in the river. And the "
"clothes washing, lawn watering, and farm irrigation use extra water and sometimes pollute local water sources with detergents and fertilizers, changing the quantity and quality of the available water."
msgstr "人類是如何影響環境的？「水」就是一個例子。幾乎所有生物都需要水才能生存。不過，大多數的野生動物每天只需從河流和湖泊取得一小口的水來滿足他們的需求。但是人類做出了哪些事情，超越了簡單的日常所需只為了滿足他們的渴望？首先，我們為了發電而攔截了河川建造大壩，且把大壩建築高建造水庫以供應大城市用水，建造湖泊得以划船、游泳和釣魚。人類使用水，不僅僅拿來飲用，也拿來洗澡、洗衣服與澆水。以及，許多大農場和牧場生產我們所吃的食物，必須使用大量的水來灌溉(水)作物及畜養畜生(動物)。所有這些人類的活動大大影響環境，大壩把河流變成了湖泊，這會影響河流的植物和動物的生存；洗衣服、澆水與農業灌溉使用了大量的水，清潔劑與化學肥料汙染當地的水源，改變了可用水的量和品質。"

"The burning of fossil fuels is another example of how the resources we use from the environment to make us more comfortable and make our lives better can also have negative impacts on the environment - which then can have negative impacts on us as well. For instance, we burn coal to make electricity and we burn gasoline to run our cars. Coal and gasoline are examples of \"<span class='key'>fossil fuels</span>\" because they're formed in the ground from the remains of dead plants from millions of years ago. Electricity and cars are hugely important in making our lives more comfortable. Can you imagine living in the dark and walking everywhere you had to go? But burning these fossil fuels can also have a very negative impact on the environment - and on you! Most scientists that study climates have strong evidence to believe that one of the by-products of burning fossil fuels is a powerful pollutant - <span class='key'>carbon dioxide</span> "
"(CO<sub>2</sub>) - which is causing the earth to heat up, producing heat waves of record high temperatures, wildfires, and more powerful storms."
msgstr "化石燃料的燃燒是我們從環境取得資源以使我們更舒適、生活更好的另一個很好的例子，這不僅造成了環境負面的影響，對我們人類也是，例如：我們燃收煤炭來發電；燃燒汽油來發動汽車。煤炭和汽油都是“化石燃料”的例子，他們是由地表上死亡的植物遺跡經過數百萬年後所形成的。為使我們的生活更舒適，電力和汽車是極為重要的。你能想像生活在黑暗之中嗎？但是燃燒這些化石燃料，對於環境和人類造成極大的負面影響。大多數研究氣候的科學家有證據認為燃燒化石燃料後產生的副產物“二氧化碳”是造成地球升溫、產生創紀錄的高溫、森林火災與更為猛烈的風暴之最大汙染源。"

msgid "<span class='key'>Pollutants</span> are any new substances, or extra abnormal amounts of naturally occurring substances, that are introduced by human activities into the air, water, or earth. So even though there are benefits for you from burning fossil fuels for electricity and transportation, there may also be some very harmful impacts to the environment from the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) gas pollutants produced from this human activity."
msgstr "汙染物是新的、額外存在且異常的天然物質，是經由人類活動而進入空氣、水和大地之中。所以，即使為了使用電與運輸而燃燒化石燃料對人是有益處的，但這些因人類活動而產生的汙染物“二氧化碳”氣體對環境是非常有害的。"

msgid "But humans are smart! Both individually and as a society, there are things we can do to minimize the harmful impact we have on the environment by changing our behavior.

"So let's get back to how you can become an EcoKid Super Ranger hero. It's pretty easy to understand but challenging to do. First, you have to understand one big idea, and that is humans can change the way they do things - their behavior - to minimize their impact on the environment. If you know what the impact on the environment is for the things you do, then you can change what you do to lessen the impact. For instance, if you know that driving a car causes air pollution, including the \"greenhouse gas\" CO<sub>2</sub> that may be causing <span class='key'>global climate change</span>, then - and here's the challenging part - you can change your behavior to use a car less to get you where you need to go. You could walk, ride your bike, ask your parents to start a carpool with your friends, or ride a bus to wherever you're going if it's safe. All of these things cut down on the number of miles each car is driven so it cuts down on the amount of "
"pollutants the car gives off. PLUS!! Your parents save money on gas. And if you really want to save gas, you could talk to your parents about getting a <span class='key'>hybrid</span> electric car. These are things that you personally can do with your parents and your friends. But if you want to be a real EcoKid Super Ranger, the greatest positive impact you can have is by getting your whole community involved and thinking about all the possible things your school or community can do to help the environment. Then you really would be a superhero!!!"
