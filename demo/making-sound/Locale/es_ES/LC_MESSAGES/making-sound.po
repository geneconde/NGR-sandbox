msgid "All of the above are correct."

msgid "For sound waves to travel, they must have a material to move through. Sound waves travel through air, but they can also travel through water and solid materials like wood or metal. When a vibrating object causes the air around it to vibrate, sound is produced. The sound carries energy, and when that energy reaches your ears, it causes your eardrum to move back and forth. Check out the rest of this review to learn more about making sound!"

msgstr ""

msgid "<span class='key'>Sound</span> is a form of <span class='key'>energy</span>. Sounds are made when the matter in solids, liquids or gases is made to move or vibrate up and down or to and fro. For example, a hummingbird uses energy to move its wings to fly. The very fast movement or <span class='key'>vibration</span> of the wings causes the air around the wings to vibrate and make a \"humming\" sound. Crickets make their \"chirping\" sound by rubbing their upper and lower wings against each other and causing the air vibrate to make the sounds you hear on a warm summer's night."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scientists use the term <span class='key'>medium</span> to describe the matter that sound travels through. Without a medium, there is no sound. One way to describe what happens when the matter in solids, liquids or gases vibrates to make sound is to think about what would happen if you dangled a \"slinky\" from your hand and moved your hand up and down. The coils in the slinky move up and down, giving the slinky a bobbing-type motion. If you held the slinky on a flat surface and pulled it back and let go, it would also move back and forth, to and fro. When matter in solids, liquids or gases is made to move or vibrate, the matter moves like the slinky!"
msgstr ""

msgid "What makes sounds different? How matter vibrates or moves back and forth determines what the sound will be like. Scientists describe how matter moves back and forth as sound waves and use graphs like the one shown here to represent different sound waves. <span class='key'>Sound waves</span> are called <span class='key'>longitudinal waves</span>. These are the type of wave produced by moving the slinky back and forth in a direction parallel to the slinky. This is similar to the way sound is produced when a stereo speaker pushes and pulls on the air in front of it."

msgstr ""

msgid "The speed of light is dependent upon the medium it is travelling through."

msgid "Light waves can bounce off of objects."

msgid "Nope. Sound waves also have different frequencies that we hear as different notes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nope. Sound waves and light waves both have different speeds depending on the characteristics of the materials they are travelling through."

msgid "More big ideas about... making sound"
msgstr ""

msgid "The <span class='key'>pitch</span> of a sound is described in terms of how many sound waves are made in a period of time. The number of sound waves that are made in a second is referred to as the <span class='key'>frequency</span> or pitch of the sound. The faster something vibrates, the higher the pitch of a sound. In the image below, the top slinky shows waves with a higher frequency. They would be produced by an object that is vibrating more rapidly than the object producing the waves in the bottom slinky. In the time period shown in this image, only two compressions are visible in the bottom slinky, while you can see four compressions in the top image."
msgstr ""

msgid "The sound of thunder and the buzz of a mosquito are different in another important way. The rumble of thunder is much louder than the buzz of a mosquito. The <span class='key'>loudness</span> of a sound depends on how much <span class='key'>energy</span> goes in to making the sound. For example, thunder is produced when large amounts of air are made to vibrate in large waves. The sound made by a mosquito is very quiet because the tiny wings move only a small amount of air. Looking at the image of the slinkys below, both waves have the same frequency. You can see the same number of compressions in each slinky. They differ in terms of the energy travelling along the slinky. It takes more energy to cause the spring to bunch up and spread out in the top slinky, and less energy to move the slinky in the bottom image. Similarly, the loudness of a sound is determined by how much the pressure in the air changes as the sound wave passes through it."

At that speed, light can travel from the moon to Earth in just over one second. By comparison, light travels through air a million times faster than sound. That's why you see the flash of lightning before you hear the crack of the thunder, or see a batter knock a baseball deep into the outfield before you hear the crack of the bat. During a thunderstorm, you can determine how far you are from the lightning by counting the seconds between when you see the flash, and when you hear the thunder. Sound travels close to one mile in five seconds. So if you divide the seconds between the flash and the thunder by five, you'll know how many miles away the lightning hit."

msgid "Different sounds made by different things, for example, guitars, violins, drums, flutes and tubas, make different patterns of waves with different distances between them. Plucking, banging, whispering and yelling are all vibrations in the air, but these sounds are all very different. This is because the thickness and length of things and the temperature of the surroundings that sound travels through affect the speed of sound. For instance, a tuba is much thicker and larger than a flute so the tuba makes a low-pitched sound and the flute makes a high-pitched sound. The low-pitched tuba sound has big gaps between waves and the high-pitched flute has waves that are bunched together or shorter. Loud sounds have more <span class='key'>molecules</span> moving and more energy than soft sounds. So a thicker guitar string will make louder, deeper sounds than a thinner, skinnier guitar string which will make a higher sound."

msgid "The different instruments in the orchestra produce different sounds by different methods. The string instruments, such as violin, viola, cello and bass, produce sound by causing strings to vibrate. The hollow wooden bodies of those instruments, along with the different string lengths, produce distinctive sounds. The clarinets, saxophones, oboes and bassoons are all woodwind instruments that make use of a thin vibrating piece of wood, known as a reed, to create their sounds. The bright sounds of the brass instruments, the trumpet, French horn and coronet, are created by vibrating the lips while blowing air into the mouthpiece. Even when they're playing the same musical note, it is possible to tell these instruments apart based on their unique combination of different frequencies of sound waves. Engineers can use computers to mimic these sounds. By analyzing the mix of different frequencies in a note, the engineers can produce realistic sounding imitations of actual instruments. It is even possible to use computers to correct the notes sung by a human voice."

Changing how fast something vibrates changes the <span class='key'>pitch</span> of the sound.
