msgstr "記住你上次過生日時吹熄了生日蛋糕上的蠟燭嗎？這整個過程經歷了物質的化學與物理變化。"

msgid "There's a lot to be learned at your birthday party about how different kinds of matter interact to cause chemical and physical changes in matter. The baking of your birthday cake involves chemical reactions that are good examples of chemical changes in the ingredients that make the cake. The burning of the candles involves both physical changes and chemical changes in the matter that makes up the candles. But the making of the lemonade you drink and making the ice that keeps the lemonade cold are not chemical changes – they are physical changes that happen in the sugar, the water and the lemonade mix that make your lemonade. Let's see what all of this means."
msgstr "在你的生日派對上，有許多關於不同種類的物質如何相互作用，以引起物質的化學和物理變化，這些都是必須學習的。生日蛋糕的烘烤涉及的化學反應，是蛋糕成分起化學變化很好的例子。蠟燭燃燒同時涉及物質的物理變化及化學變化。但是你製作檸檬水來喝和製作冰塊使檸檬變得冰涼，這些皆沒有化學變化。這物理變化發生在糖、水和檸檬水混合形成你所喝的檸檬水。讓我們來看看這所有一切的意義。"

msgstr "當你料理從超市中買來的蛋糕粉時，它們會自行融合成為蛋糕。"

msgid "Simply stirring the ingredients together just makes a mixture of ingredients but not a cake. Even if you let the mixture sit for a long time, you still won't get a cake. The chemicals in the ingredients, like the eggs and milk and sugar, don't automatically combine and change to make the cake. The heat from the oven causes the chemicals that make up the cake ingredients to have a chemical reaction that changes them into new chemicals that make up a cake. These new chemicals give the cake its new properties that are different from those of the ingredients. You can't taste raw eggs or flour or milk anymore. But you can taste cake."
msgstr "簡單的將原料攪拌再一起製成原料混合物但不是蛋糕。就算你將原料混合物放置一段時間，還是不會自己變成蛋糕。原料之中的化學物，例如：雞蛋、牛奶、糖，它們不會自動融合成為蛋糕。是烤箱中的熱源造成蛋糕原料的化學變化而形成新的化學物成為真正的蛋糕。這些新的化學物質讓蛋糕產生與原料截然不同的新特性。你無法單獨嘗到生蛋、麵粉或是牛奶的味道，你嚐到的是蛋糕的味道。"

Making lemonade for your birthday party is a good example of mixing two or more different substances and getting a new substance that has different <span class='key'>properties</span>. That's what scientists call a <span class='key'>physical change</span>. Let's make some lemonade and see what that means."
msgstr "讓我們從製作檸檬汁出發吧！沒有什麼比得上一大瓶沁涼的檸檬汁搭配上美味的生日蛋糕了。製作生日派對的檸檬汁是個很好的例子去解釋如何混合兩種不同特性的物質而產生出新的物質。而這就是科學上所說的物理變化。讓我們來製作檸檬汁並了解「物理變化」的涵義吧。"

msgid "When you mix the lemonade mix with water and sugar, you get a new substance with new properties - lemonade. The lemonade mix by itself is dry and \"lemony\" tasting but bitter. The water by itself is wet but tasteless. And the sugar is dry but sweet. Mix them all together and you get lemonade, which has the properties of all three ingredients combined – wet, lemony-tasting, and sweet – but are different from each of the ingredients by themselves. Lemonade is a good example of a <span class='key'>mixture</span>."
msgstr "當你用水及糖混合檸檬原料粉時，你得到一個新特性的物質：檸檬汁。檸檬原料粉本身是乾的，嘗起來只有酸味。而水是液態且無色無味。糖則是乾且甜的。將這三方原料混合在一起就會得到檸檬汁，並且綜合了三個原料的特性：液態、檸檬味及甜味，但卻又與原本自身的特性稍有不同。檸檬汁是個「混合物」的好例子。"

msgid "A mixture is an example of a physical change because the original ingredients, like the sugar, the water, and the lemonade mix, don't turn into new chemicals – they just mix together. If you simply let the lemonade stand on your table long enough – and it may take a couple of days – the water part of the mixture will eventually <span class='key'>evaporate</span> – which means it goes up into the air and becomes part of the air. Then, if you look in the bottom of the pitcher, you'll see the sugar and the lemonade mix are still there!  It came back!! Well, it was always there, but it was just mixed in with the water. The sugar always stayed sugar, and the lemonade mix stayed lemonade mix. They never changed into anything else. And the water <span class='key'>evaporating</span> – going from liquid to gas – is another example of a <span class='key'>physical change</span>. We'll talk more about that later."
msgstr "混合物是物理變化的例子，因為原本的成分，如糖、水和檸檬汁混合，並沒有產生新的化合物，它們就只是混合在一起而已。如果你讓檸檬水放在桌上足夠的時間，可能需要一兩天，混合物中一部分的水最終會蒸發，也就是它跑到空氣中成為空氣的一部分。接著，你看看罐子的底部，你會看到糖和檸檬汁仍存在！它回來了！這是永遠存在的，只是混合在水中而已。糖還是糖，檸檬汁還是檸檬汁。它們從來沒有變成別的東西。水的蒸發從液體變成氣體，是一個物理變化的另一個例子。我們後面將會詳細討論。"

msgid "And here's something else that's important about mixing <span class='key'>substances</span> together that causes physical changes. Even though the mixture might have new properties compared to the ingredients, the weight (or mass) of the mixture is always exactly the same as the weight of all the ingredients combined. No new matter is created or none of the matter is destroyed. This idea is called <span class='key'>Conservation of Matter</span> and is one of the most important ideas in all of science."
msgstr "下面是其他一些重要的關於物質混合在一起引起物理變化的例子。儘管混合物相較於原料可能具有新的特性，但混合物的重量（或質量）始終和所有原料重量總和相同。沒有新的物質產生也沒有物質被破壞。這個概念被稱為「物質的守恆」，是所有科學中最重要的概念之一。"

msgid "Making ice cubes is even easier than making lemonade! All you have to do is add some liquid water to an ice cube tray, put it in the freezer, and wait a couple of hours until it freezes into solid water – called ice. It's called changing states of matter - in this case from liquid to solid. Changing states of matter of substances occur because of changes in temperature. This is another example of a physical change that can happen to a substance. Most substances like water can commonly exist in three different states of matter – solids, liquids, and gas. But what makes water unusual is that it can exist in all three states of matter at temperatures that commonly occur in everyday life on earth."
msgstr "製作冰塊比製作檸檬汁更容易！你所有做的就是把液態的水加入製冰盤，放入冰櫃中等待數小時，直到結凍成固態的水，稱作為冰。從液態變成固態，這就是所謂的改變物質的狀態。物質因為溫度的變化而發生狀態改變，這是物質發生物理變化的另一個例子。大多數的物質，像是水通常可以存在在三個不同狀態 - 固態、液態和氣態。但水不同尋常的是，它可以在我們地球上日常生活當中的溫度下存在三種狀態。"

msgid "<span class='key'>Changing states of matter</span> just means changing a substance – like water - from a solid to a liquid or a liquid to a gas – or going the other way - from a gas to a liquid or a liquid to a solid, simply by changing the temperature. In making ice cubes, the water changed its properties from being liquid at room temperature to being cold and solid when it freezes. But it's still water. It didn't change what it is - just some of its properties changed. And - if you just leave the ice alone at room temperature for an hour or so, the ice will melt back to liquid water again– or change from a solid state – ice - into the liquid state - liquid water – all by itself. That means the process of changing states of matter is <span class='key'>reversible</span>. It can go either way."
msgstr "物質狀態的改變就只是意味著改變物質本身，例如水從固態到液態或液態到氣態，或另一種方式由氣態到液態或液態至固態，這些藉著簡單地改變溫度。在製造冰塊時，水從室溫下的液態到冷凍結成固態而改變了它的性質，但仍然還是水。它並沒有改變它自己，只是它的一些特性改變。但如果你把冰塊放在室溫下一小時左右，冰就會再次融化回水，也就是從固態的冰改變成液態的水，全部只發生於水本身。這意味著物質的狀態改變的過程是可逆的，它可以改變至任何一種狀態。"

msgid "Most matter can exist in a solid state, liquid state, or gaseous state, depending on the temperature. But sometimes, for some substances like iron, the temperature has to be really hot – like in a really hot furnace to get it to become liquid."
msgstr "根據不同溫度，大多數的物質可以以固態、液態或氣態的狀態存在。但有時候對於某些物質，例如鐵就必須要非常熱的溫度，就像需要一個真正的熱爐讓它變成液體。"

msgid "Not really – the size of a substance may change because of a change in state – like liquid water expands and gets bigger when it freezes – but that doesn't cause the water to freeze and change state – it's the result of water freezing."
msgstr "不是–因為狀態變化，物質的大小可能改變，像是液態水結凍時膨脹且變大，但大小的改變並不會造成水結凍並改變狀態，大小的改變是結凍的結果。"

msgid "Yes – The temperature of any substance normally is the cause of most common substances changing state under normal conditions. For instance, when you cool liquid water to below its freezing point, it changes state to become solid ice."
msgstr "是–在正常條件下，溫度通常是最常見改變狀態的原因。例如，當你降低液態水的溫度低於冰點，它改變狀態成為固態。"

msgid "No – The shape of a substance doesn't cause it to change states."
msgstr "否–物質的形狀不會導致它改變狀態。"

msgid "No – The color of a substance doesn’t cause it to change states. But if a substance is dark-colored, it may absorb sunlight more than if it was a light color. This might heat it up and cause it to melt. But it’s still the temperature increase that causes the melting."
msgstr "否–物質的顏色不導致其狀態改變。但是，如果一種物質是深色，它會比亮色物質吸收的太陽光還多。這可能會熱起來，並使其熔化。但這仍然是因為溫度升高，導致融化。"

msgid "Not quite – substance turning from a solid to a liquid is called melting – which is a change of state."
msgstr "不完全正確–物質從固體變成液體被稱為熔化，這是狀態的改變。"

msgid "Not quite – water freezing – going from a liquid to a solid - is a change of state."
msgstr "不完全正確–水結冰，從液體變成固體，是狀態的變化。"

msgid "Not quite – water evaporating – going from a liquid to a gas - is a change of state."
msgstr "不完全正確–水蒸發，從液體變成氣體，是狀態的變化。"

msgid "Correct – Liquid water getting colder – without freezing is not a change of state. It starts out liquid and is still liquid after it gets colder, so there's no change of state."
msgstr "正確–液態水變冷，不凍結並不是狀態的變化。它開始時是液態，變冷後仍是液態，所以狀態並沒有改變。"

Does it look like something you'd want to eat?  But then all the ingredients got mixed together and put in the hot oven to bake. Then what happened? After baking in the oven at about 350 degrees for 30-45 minutes, that big mess in the bowl changed. Out popped a cake that looks and feels and tastes totally different than the ingredients before baking. Look at the ingredients in the bowl, then look at the slice of cake.

A <span class='key'>chemical compound</span> is when two or more different elements – like carbon and hydrogen - combine to form a compound like wax, or when hydrogen and oxygen combine to form a different compound called water."
msgstr "蠟燭是由蠟製成，是一個由碳元素和氫元素組成的化合物。化合物是指由兩個或兩個以上的不同元素所組成，像是碳和氫結合形成似蠟的化合物，或是當氫氣和氧氣結合形成不同的化合物，稱為水。"

msgid "When you light the candles, the heat from the burning candlewick – the string - melts some of the solid wax and turns it into liquid wax. That's a physical change because the change is reversible – which means, if you just let the melted wax cool - it will turn right back into solid wax again. But here's something that's not so obvious – the heat also turns some liquid wax into a gas. That's also a physical change because if you could quickly cool the gas again, it would turn back into liquid and then solid wax."
msgstr "當你點燃蠟燭，熱是來自燃燒蠟燭燭芯，熱串聯融化一些固體的蠟，把它轉變成液態狀的蠟。這是一個物理變化，因為變化是可逆。這意味著，如果你讓融化的蠟冷卻，他又會再次變成固體狀。但是有些東西並不是那麼明顯容易觀察，熱也會使液態的蠟變成氣體。這也是一種物理變化，因為如果你很快地再次冷卻氣體，他可以再變回液體，然後再變回固體。"

msgid "But here's the interesting thing – the gas formed by heating the wax immediately has a <span class='key'>chemical reaction</span> with the oxygen in the air to make the flame which generates light and heat. This chemical reaction is what we commonly call “burning” but scientists call combustion. Not only does the chemical reaction create energy in the form of heat and light, but it also changes the methane gas from the wax into carbon dioxide and water vapor gases, which mix with the air around the candle. So the chemical compound from the melted wax, the methane gas, reacts with oxygen from the air and creates heat, light, water vapor and carbon dioxide gas. This is an example of a chemical reaction and <span class='key'>chemical change</span>, which is not <span class='key'>reversible</span>, because if you let the water and carbon dioxide cool or do almost anything else to them, they will not turn back into wax. <br>This is the chemical reaction for the burning (also called combustion) process:"

msgstr "總結有關於「化學與物理變化」的大概念"

msgid "All matter – the stuff or substances that everything is made of – has properties that you can see, feel, touch, taste, or hear. These properties might be: how hard the substance is; what color it is; whether it's a solid, liquid or gas; how it tastes; or anything else you can observe with your senses. These are all called <span class='key'>\"properties of matter\"</span>.<br/>"
msgstr "所有物質都有自己的特性，你可以看得到、感受到、觸摸的到、嚐得到或聽得到。這些特性可能是：物質多硬；什麼顏色；是固體、液體或氣體；嘗起來味道如何；或任何你可以用感官觀察的。這些就是所謂的“物質的特性”。"

msgid "Sometimes, things you do to matter can change these properties. Like you can heat or cool substances that change them from a solid to a liquid or a gas. This kind of change is called a <span class='key'>change of state</span>. The word \"state\" means: Is it in a solid, liquid, or gaseous, \"state\"? Or you can mix substances together. Mixing water and sugar together changes the properties of both the sugar and the water to make a new substance – a <span class='key'>mixture</span> - called sugar water that is wet and sweet.<br/>"
msgstr "有時候，你對物質做的處理會改變它的特性。像是你可以加熱或冷卻物質讓它們從固體變成液體或氣體。這種變化被稱為狀態的改變。“狀態”這個單字是指：它是在固體、液體還是氣體的狀態？或者你可以把物質混合在一起。把糖和水混合在一起改變了糖和水的性質，且形成一個濕的和甜的混合物，稱為糖水。"

msgid "Both mixtures and changes of state are examples of <span class='key'>physical changes</span> to matter because each of these changes is easily reversible. Heating may change solid water – ice - into liquid water but freezing the liquid water easily reverses the change back to solid water. And adding sugar to water might create sugar water but you can reverse the change and get both the plain water and the sugar back by letting the water evaporate.<br/>"
msgstr "混合物和狀態變化是物質物理變化的例子，因為這些變化是很容易恢復的。加熱可改變固態的水(冰)變成液態水，但凍結液態水後，便能轉變回固態的水。且糖加到水裡形成糖水，但你可以逆轉這個變化，通過讓水蒸發使白開水和糖回來。"

msgid "Another kind of change to matter is called <span class='key'>chemical change</span>. This is a little bit different and more complicated than physical change. In chemical change when two or more different substances are mixed together, and sometimes when you also heat them too, they change into totally different substances with new and different properties. This process is called a <span class='key'>chemical reaction</span>. Usually, after a chemical reaction, the new substances produced cannot easily be changed back to the original substances.<br/>"
msgstr "在化學變化中，當兩個或是兩個以上的物質混合在一起，有時候你還加熱它們，它們就會變成完全不同的物質，擁有新的且不同的特性。這個過程被稱為化學反應。通常，化學反應過後，所產生的新物質不能輕易地改變回原來的物質。每當物理變化或化學變化發生，不管它們是什麼，有一件事情是非常重要的。在一起的所有物質原始的重量（質量）會等於所有物質最終的重量（質量）。不論是生成或銷毀，這是一個「物質的守恆」原則，是所有科學中最重要的思想之一。"

msgid "Whenever physical changes or chemical changes happen, no matter what they are, there is one thing that is very important. The weight (mass) of the all the original substances (matter) together is the same as the weight (mass) of all substances (matter)  you end up with. No matter is either created or destroyed. This principle is called the <span class='key'>Conservation of Matter</span> and is one of the most important ideas in all of science.<br/>"
